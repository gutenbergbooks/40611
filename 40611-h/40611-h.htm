<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>HERO AND HEROINE MEET</h3>

<p class="indent">The advent of its regatta is usually the
herald of a sea-side season&#39;s demise.
Wivernsea, as yet, is not sufficiently developed
to justify indulgence in a water festival. So
far, its carnival flights have been confined
within the limits of flower shows and the treats
of its Sunday school.</p>

<p class="indent">The builder&mdash;his surname is Jerry&mdash;is
around with a rule though. His conspiracy
with the man who plots lands and dispenses
free luncheons and railway tickets, will possibly
wreak a change on that part of the map&#39;s
countenance. Increased population may
render the place more famous&mdash;or infamous.
So very much depends on one&#39;s viewpoint.</p>

<p class="indent">The houses of Wivernsea are built in its bay.
Stuck in round the fringe of it like teeth in a
lower jaw. Picture to yourself the long ago&mdash;the
bay&#39;s origin&mdash;and the present appearance
of the place may come before you. If possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
to introduce a belief that there were giants in
the earth in those days it will make realization
simpler. Because it looks as if a mammoth
had snapped at the coast just there and bitten
out a huge mouthful.</p>

<p class="indent">If your imagination is sufficiently elastic to
give play to it, conceive houses being dropped
into the marks left by the giant&#39;s teeth&mdash;a sort
of dental stopping. So may be garnered a fair
idea of the presentment of this particular
indentation in the land.</p>

<p class="indent">When the goose of Michaelmas is shaking in
its scales, Wivernsea lodging letters encroach
on the farmer&#39;s privilege. The closing time of
their harvest is near enough to be grumbled at.
It is painful knowledge to them that visitors
scuttle away as September ends. The exodus
is due to some absurd belief that the weather
then&mdash;like a school at the advent of the holidays&mdash;breaks
up.</p>

<p class="indent">In the ears of one man&mdash;William Masters by
name, binder-together-of-sensational-incidents
in-book-form by profession&mdash;such grumbles
tingled pleasantly. Because the usual October
Wivernsea weather is mild and bright and
rainless. Being a non-gregarious man, the
place shaped before his eyes as a land flowing
with milk and honey. He knew it to be good
then.</p>

<p class="indent">Knowledge is the wing on which we fly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
heaven. In this instance, the author&#39;s flight
from London was via the London and South
Western Railway Company&#39;s terminus. Later
on he told himself that it was proving&mdash;veritably&mdash;his
Waterloo.</p>

<p class="indent">Wivernsea&#39;s sea wall is known locally as the
Esplanade. Euphemisms&mdash;sacrifices to vanity
at the expense of truth&mdash;are not uncommon
objects of the seashore. The walk terminated
eastwards with the abruptness of a cinematograph
view. A private owner claimed the
land there.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not an undisputed claim. Opposition
made the owner handle the matter with mailed
fist. To make his position stronger he erected
a high wall. If it did not prevent his opponents
going further with their labial opposition,
it effectually prevented them from going
further along the parade.</p>

<p class="indent">The embellishments of the wall were, apparently,
the outcome of deep thought. Its top
was artistically embroidered with spikes and
broken bottles. This sharply jagged crown
was known locally as a shivery-freeze. Give
the average man an opportunity to mispronounce
a word and his success may be counted
on every time.</p>

<p class="indent">Warnings to trespassers and threats of prosecution
garnished the wall&#39;s face with the
liberality of almonds in a piece of French rock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
The everyday man might well be excused a
fear that there was danger in letting an unguarded
eye rest on it.</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst others, the wall barred the easterly
progress of William Masters. In his instance
no chagrin resulted. It was a boast of his that
he possessed views of his own: the things
which other people smile at unpleasantly and
label eccentricities. The owner of the wall
was a man after his own heart. Undoubtedly
a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not good that man should be alone. But
the author had not yet realized the greatness of
that truth. He had been heard to voice the
nature of his Ultima Thule: undisturbed
existence in a cot. Not beside the hill,
but in the centre of a big field. The situation
to be enhanced by possession of a shot gun,
wherewith to pepper trespassers on his
solitude.</p>

<p class="indent">Strangers who heard Masters speak so, felt
inclination to move away a pace; were
prompted to thoughts of Hanwell and Colney
Hatch. His friends&mdash;another boast of his was
the poverty of their number&mdash;smiled. The
idea of Masters hurting a fly appealed to the
humour in them.</p>

<p class="indent">But, as the blackest hat may have a silver-paper
lining, so the wall served a good purpose.
It acted as a shelter from the one thing which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
disturbed the enjoyment of October in
Wivernsea: that wind which is said to be good
for neither man nor beast. Thoughtful hands
had placed a comfortable seat within the wall&#39;s
shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">Knowledge of these things had inspired
Masters&#39; journey to Wivernsea. Where he
had stayed before the landlady had rooms
vacant. She knew his requirements and,
hitherto, had suited him admirably. Had even
acquired the knowledge that his visits to
Wivernsea were not prompted solely by a
desire to hear her talk!</p>

<p class="indent">Having done justice to a hastily prepared
luncheon, Masters slipped a note book into his
pocket and sallied forth. His route was
easterly, its termination his favourite seat at
the end of the Parade. There were some hours
left of warmth and sunshine: the author&#39;s
intent was to avail himself of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Seated, he for a time succumbed to the
charm of the water as it stole out and away.
Listened to its lapping as it broadened the
ribbon of sand at each receding wave. Then,
turning a deaf ear to the charm and his eyes on
to his note book, he buried himself in the
particular chapter on which he was engaged.</p>

<p class="indent">The writer&#39;s concentration was not of the
plumbless kind. Sound of a girl&#39;s voice roused
him from his depth of thought. It should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
be gathered from that that the sex had any
extraordinary influence over him&mdash;save when
it was very young.</p>

<p class="indent">He loved children. Loved them best before
the rubbing off of what is called their corners:
the sweetness of what is actually the innocence
we all come into the world with&mdash;which it
seems the business of the world to destroy.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters guessed from the voice that it belonged
to a very little girl. Looking up, saw
standing in front of him proof of the correctness
of his guess. A blue-eyed&mdash;wide-open-eyed-with-astonishment
too at seeing him
there&mdash;little maid. She had turned the parade
corner, and in doing so came on him unexpectedly.
It was plain that she had pulled up
suddenly at seeing him there. Just as suddenly
called out in her clear, childish treble:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! There&#39;s someone on your seat, Miss
Mivvins!"</p>

<p class="indent">The young lady so addressed came into view
at that moment, round the bushes planted at
the corner&mdash;the little one having, as usual,
run on ahead.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins flushed a little. Becomingly,
for otherwise the face might have been considered
a trifle too pale. The possibility of
the child&#39;s speech being considered rude induced
her to say in an undertone:</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, Gracie, dear!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
The speech reached Masters&#39; ears. He was
at once struck with the governess&#39;s singularly
sweet voice. When he looked at the place
whence the voice issued, he thought it the
prettiest mouth he had ever set eyes on. The
little droop of sadness at its corners mellowed
rather than took away from the sweetness of
it.</p>

<p class="indent">The lips&mdash;ripe red in colour, Cupid&#39;s bowed
in shape&mdash;enchanting as they were, did not
hold his attention in iron bonds. His glance
wandered to her eyes and hair. From that
inspection was formed an opinion&mdash;one which
he never changed.</p>

<p class="indent">The features were the most beautiful and
womanly ones he had ever seen. Just as sweet
a face as a woman with golden hair&mdash;that
peculiar tint of gold which the sun ever seems
anxious to search amongst&mdash;and forget-me-not
eyes, can possess at the age of three-and
twenty. She was good to look upon.</p>

<p class="indent">Observation was a trick of Masters&#39; trade.
The practice of it enabled him to paint a picture
in a paragraph. What he saw in one glimpse
of Miss Mivvins&#39; face was eloquence itself.
But of that gentle, outward-going radiance in
her eyes the merest layman would have been
sentient. It was the kind of which one felt
even a blind man must be conscious.</p>

<p class="indent">Details appealed to Masters just then. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
happened to be engaged at the moment on the
description of a heroine. When he saw Miss
Mivvins his difficulty about shaping the book-woman
vanished. In flesh and blood she stood
before him. All he needed was to describe
what he saw: she would fit in all respects.</p>

<p class="indent">Save her name. He was not particularly
struck with that.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE CHILD, THE WISE MAN, AND THE LADY</h3>

<p class="indent">Proverbially women love men&#39;s
approbation. Something of the feeling
within him must have evidenced itself in
Masters&#39; eyes. His attentive scrutiny&mdash;despite
all there was of respect in it&mdash;did not, apparently,
please Miss Mivvins. Possibly, she was
inclined to consider his admiration rudeness.
Anyway she called:</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, Gracie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Taking the child&#39;s little hand in her own
neatly gloved one as she spoke, the woman
turned, evidently intent on walking back
in the direction whence she had come.</p>

<p class="indent">That brought Masters to his feet in a
moment&mdash;cap in hand, and apology in
mouth. Full of crudities as was his character,
he possessed an instinctive courtesy.
In all the arraignments for his breaches
of Society&#39;s unwritten laws, impoliteness
had never figured. He spoke; said:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
"Pray do not let me drive you away!
Possession may be nine points of the law,
but we may consider ourselves beyond the
pale of its practice here. If, as I hear&mdash;from
lips the truth of which it would be
absurd to doubt&mdash;that this is considered
your seat," his smile was not an unpleasing
one, "I should never forgive
myself if trespass of mine interfered with
the owner&#39;s use of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that pen you are using," inquired
Gracie suddenly, à propos of nothing, "one
of those you put the ink in at the wrong
end, and trickle it out of the other?"</p>

<p class="indent">A softness blended with the smile on
Masters&#39; face and merged into that kindly
expression of the strong for the weak. It
was the successful catching of just such
tenderness which made Landseer&#39;s name
figure so prominently in the world of Art.
As the author looked down at the mite from
his six-feet altitude, the look on his face
was an irresistible reminder of a St. Bernard&#39;s
kindness to a toy terrier.</p>

<p class="indent">"You have accurately described it, little
woman," he answered. "But it does not
always trickle when you want it to&mdash;though
it generally does when you don&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent">The child looked mystified; evidently
deemed further explanation necessary. Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
Mivvins was still standing, waiting to go.
Masters hesitated; looked from one to the
other. Politeness made him say:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am leaving&mdash;pray be seated."</p>

<p class="indent">But the woman saw through that. Would
have been very high up the fool grade indeed
had she failed to do so. It really was quite
too transparent an artifice. When truth is
sacrificed on the altar of politeness the ceremony
needs skill, otherwise the lie becomes
even more offensive than the act it was to
cover.</p>

<p class="indent">His little speech induced her to take a step
forward; made her say:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no! Do not let me drive you
away!"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke impulsively; hurriedly. Masters
thought with everything in the tone that was
desirable in a woman&#39;s voice. He smiled as
he expostulated:</p>

<p class="indent">"But you remember, surely&mdash;it is not many
moments ago&mdash;you were quite willing to allow
me to drive you away."</p>

<p class="indent">Then she smiled too. Smiles which brought
into play mouth and eyes and the dimples in
her cheeks. From his own face the gravity&mdash;some
people called it Austerity&mdash;had already
departed. There was a peculiarly softening
influence about Miss Mivvins. Perhaps his
own relaxing was the result of that.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
"It is a long seat."</p>

<p class="indent">He indicated its measurement with a sweep
of his hand as he spoke; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Let its length be our way out of the difficulty&mdash;it
is a long lane that has no turning.
How will it be if we make it large enough for
both?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was a tentative sort of invitation. An
invisible olive branch to which her hand went
out. Again she smiled. A moment&#39;s hesitation
... then seated herself.</p>

<p class="indent">From the bag depending by silken cords
from her wrist she drew a book. Having
given the little girl sundry directions as to the
assumption of preternatural virtue, the woman
commenced to read.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters resumed his place at the other end
of the seat. Had book in hand too: manuscript
book. He had come out with intent to write;
told himself that fulfilment was necessary.
But he had Gracie to reckon with.</p>

<p class="indent">The sharp eyes of that four-year-old little
maid were furtively fixed on the magic pen.
She was trying hard to fulfil the injunction:
Be good&mdash;from the adult standpoint. But
gradually the admonition was fading from her
mind&mdash;she was very human.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while&mdash;a courage-summoning
period&mdash;the little hands were laced behind her,
and boldly facing the owner of the attraction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
the little one addressed him, in a kind of I Dare
You voice:</p>

<p class="indent">"I could write with a pen like that!"</p>

<p class="indent">For a second time the child&#39;s voice brought
the man&#39;s attention away from his work.</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled as he spoke. Looked up from his
book as he did so. Then, infusing a note of
doubt in his voice, enquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Y&mdash;yes. Quite!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as an afterthought, possibly by way of
redemption of the hesitation, the child continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I could if I had one!"</p>

<p class="indent">Finding her first venture had not roused the
lion, but fearing him a little still, she went on
defiantly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I saw a man fill one once!"</p>

<p class="indent">Such a statement as that surely could not
fail to crush a mere user of the pen! Seeing
that astonishment was expected of him,
Masters assumed an appropriate look of surprise.
His wearing of it pleased her mightily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps," he said, "you would like to
make quite sure you could write with one, eh?
Would you like to try with this?"</p>

<p class="indent">The blue eyes brightened; she was at his
side in a moment. Shyness is readily overcome
when our summers have not numbered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
five. Trustfulness at that age has rarely been
shocked.</p>

<p class="indent">Therein, perhaps, lay the secret of the attraction
children had for Masters: the sweetness
of their suspicionless existence. Viewed from
the standpoint of the after life, when&mdash;if we
act up to the axioms of the world we live in&mdash;we
trust no man, it is apt to brush across us
as refreshingly as a gust of country air.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning the leaves of his book till he came
to a blank page, Masters twisted and rested
the cover on his knee. So the open leaf was
level with the intending&mdash;eyes-sparkling-with-excitement&mdash;writer.
Then he gave the child his pen.</p>

<p class="indent">She drew a capital G&mdash;a bright little point of
tongue protruding the while. The head, too,
seemed to follow the movements of the hand.
Her intent was plain: to write her own name.</p>

<p class="indent">That was compassed. It took a little time&mdash;entailed
a huge expenditure of concentrated
energy&mdash;but she got through with it at last.
There figured on the paper the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="i0"><i>Gracie Seton-Carr.</i></span><br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The child&#39;s glance came off the page; she
moved away a pace. Looked up into his eyes,
her own flashing like diamonds. Such little
things please&mdash;in that time of happiness when
we are little ourselves. After drawing a long
breath she ejaculated triumphantly:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
"There!"</p>

<p class="indent">Once more Masters gladdened the little
one, by acting as he was expected to act.
No man on that coast could have worn a
larger-sized look of astonishment. He
cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&mdash;der&mdash;ful!"</p>

<p class="indent">A clapping of hands in her glee, and the
child danced merrily along to the other end of
the seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve written my name with one of those
funny squirter pens, Miss Mivvins! What do
you think of that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you have a funny way of keeping
your word, Gracie. You professed anxiety
to finish your castle on the sands, yet you are
spending your time on the wall!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh-h-h!"&mdash;prolonged and drawn out&mdash;"I
had forgotten all about it!"</p>

<p class="indent">Attention diverted from the pen, the child
ran down the steps on to the beach. A few
minutes after, Masters, looking up, saw her
busily at work with a spade and pail. The
implements had evidently been left there in the
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">That rather proved the excellence of the
estimate the author had made of Wivernsea
out of the season. Castle builders could leave
their tools uncared for and find them when
they returned. Not because of a superabundance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
of honesty around; rather because of
the lack of thieves.</p>

<p class="indent">The castle creator continued her work; the
pail-shaped battlements increased in number.
She handled bucket and spade with the same
earnestness, eagerness and engrossment with
which she had fingered the pen.</p>

<p class="indent">Those were methods which appealed to the
story-creator. But just now he was not working
with his own accustomed engrossment,
eagerness and earnestness. A disturbing
element had crept in.</p>

<p class="indent">From time to time he glanced towards the
other end of the seat. There the disturbing
element lay: or rather sat. It seemed that
there was something magnetic about that presence
there. He experienced a difficulty in
keeping his eyes away. Noting the neatness
of the dress worn by the woman, he could not
fail to note too its sombre hue: mourning
evidently. His lively imagination was busily
at work in a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">For him to weave a complete story with
such material, was an easy task. A pretty
girl occupied the stellar part in it. He portrayed
her as a motherless one forced to face
a hard, cold world. Depicted her seeking a
living in it as a governess.</p>

<p class="indent">That imagination of his had a habit of running
away with him. Perhaps that was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
reason why his fiction had so good a run. His
books were mostly all of the many-editioned
kind. So, neglecting his own story for fiction
of another kind, the time came of the going
down of the sun. The tint of the vasty-deep
changed: the sea grew greyer. His heroine-presumptive
closed her book and rose; cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Gracie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing that the child&#39;s attention had been
attracted, she turned, and bowing slightly,
smilingly wished Masters:</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-day!"</p>

<p class="indent">From the sands, the little girl waved a vigorous
cumbered-with-bucket-and-spade good-bye
to him. She evidently preferred jumping the
breakwaters on the way home to the more easy
path of the sea wall. The two passed altogether
from the author&#39;s sight. Not altogether from
his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Good-day! Yes, he felt it had been&mdash;distinctly
good. Till he looked at clean pages,
where writing should have been. Even then,
despite the unfinished chapter, he made no
alteration in his verdict.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been a good day.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>SHE DISCOVERS THE AUTHOR</h3>

<p class="indent">For nearly a week&mdash;before and after noon&mdash;they
met. It was a sheltered spot
Miss Mivvins walked out to each day. She
had selected it on account of its freedom from
cold winds: there was a seat on which to sit
and read. At the same time a watchful eye
could be kept on her playing-on-the-sands
charge.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters had always used it. Neither now
gave it up because of the other. Each would
have scornfully repudiated a suggestion that
the regular seeking of it arose from any other
reason. For instance, that it could be ascribed
to the other&#39;s presence.</p>

<p class="indent">But would the repudiation have been
honestly grounded? Cupid alone knows.
The love-god is a deity enshrined in mystery.
He never reveals the secrets of the wonders
he performs. Were it possible to see the
hand which lets loose the arrow, probably
there would be many a stepping aside to avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
it. The sudden striking of the dart makes it
so deadly&mdash;wounds to the heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie and the author became fast friends.
She was a winsome little soul, and children
have their own methods of creating friendships.
Masters met her advances more than
half-way: was as fond of children as he was
of flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">His friends&mdash;the nice friends who feel
privileged to say nasty things&mdash;by reason of
that fondness, professed to see in it a chance
of his redemption. They admitted a possibility
of his becoming humanized some day:
said there was at least hope for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond a Good Morning, and occasionally
a remark on one of the tenses of the weather&mdash;past,
present or future&mdash;the meetings were
bare of conversation, so far as the adults were
concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters would have been more than glad to
talk. Perhaps natural nervousness prevented
his setting the conversational ball rolling.
For he admired his companion of the seat
with a fervent admiration&mdash;unable to label
the feeling, as yet, by any other name.</p>

<p class="indent">Her presence did not disturb him now in his
seclusion. She seemed to be in keeping with
his thoughts. His thoughts of her harmonized
with the surroundings&mdash;she belonged
to them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
A vague sort of wonder took possession of
him; how it was that he had never missed her&mdash;never
known what was lacking. The more
he saw of her, the more deep his admiration
grew.</p>

<p class="indent">Admiration is the kind of thing which
develops rapidly, once it germinates. In
this instance the seed had thrown deep roots.
Masters&#39; heart seemed likely to prove fruitful
soil.</p>

<p class="indent">With Gracie he stood well. That, he felt,
was a making of headway; for the governess
unquestionably loved her charge. On the
principle of love me, love my dog, he was acting
wisely&mdash;apart from the pleasure it gave
him&mdash;in this cultivation of the little one&#39;s
affection.</p>

<p class="indent">When the child discovered his ability to
manufacture stories she instantly&mdash;the exacting
nature of her sex in its dealings with man
manifested itself even at that early age&mdash;demanded
to be told one.</p>

<p class="indent">That was the introduction of the wedge&#39;s
thin end: brought about a little change in the
current of the elders&#39; conversation. The lady
in black came out of the ice-bound silence&mdash;fringed
by a frigid Good Morning and Good
Afternoon; saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"You must not let Gracie worry you."</p>

<p class="indent">The lashes went up as she spoke and he got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
a good view of those lovely eyes of hers.
They held him spellbound. The evident admiration
in his glance caused the lashes to fall,
and he, released from the momentary thraldom,
exclaimed:</p>

<p class="indent">"Worry! How could she?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She is a perfect little glutton for stories.
Once you indulge her, she will do her best to
make your life unbearable with her clamour
for more. With food of that sort within reach
she is a regular Oliver Twist."</p>

<p class="indent">A gratified little laugh&mdash;he thought he saw
the door to Friendship opening a little wider&mdash;accompanied
his answer:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, story-telling is in my particular line!
I am full of fiction to the brim!"</p>

<p class="indent">She reciprocated his laugh, and as she picked
up, to resume, her book, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I have warned you! The consequences
be on your own head."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am moved to disregard your warning!
Gracie is so excellent a listener. That is so
flattering, you know." Then turning to the
child, he continued: "Now, run on to the
sands and finish your castle, little woman,
before the tide reaches it. When it can no
longer withstand Old Ocean&#39;s assaults and is
washed away, come back. Then I will tell
you what became of Jack after the fairy had
rescued him from the three-headed giant."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
The child was sitting on his knee with her
arms round his neck. Between the kisses she
was giving him, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You dear old thing! You are the very
nicest, delightfullest, beautifullest story-teller
I ever met."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am dethroned then?" The observation
from Miss Mivvins. "I used to be told
that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Y-y-yes. But you never told me tales
like Prince Charlie&#39;s."</p>

<p class="indent">Prince Charlie was a character in one of the
stories Masters had told the child. A prince
who had rescued innumerable princesses from
giants, ogres and demons. Instantly it had
pleased the listener to christen the narrator
after the hero.</p>

<p class="indent">All her people, she informed him gravely,
she christened out of stories. It was much
nicer than calling them by their real names.
They were so much prettier and lots easier to
remember&mdash;didn&#39;t he think so?</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, he had made answer. He quite
thought that Prince Charlie was an improvement
on his own name. But Gracie betrayed
no anxiety to know what that was. To her
henceforth he was Prince Charlie. That was
quite sufficient&mdash;she was a godmother of the
most self-satisfied type.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning to Miss Mivvins the child continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
with a trace of reproach in her voice&mdash;she felt
she had been defrauded:</p>

<p class="indent">"Besides, your giants never had three
heads!"</p>

<p class="indent">A trinity of that description&mdash;unity is
strength&mdash;appeared an unanswerable argument;
seemed to her to clinch the matter.
She climbed down from Masters&#39; knee, and
jumped her way down the steps to the sands,
with bucket and spade rattling in her little
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">As she disappeared, Masters took his courage
in both hands; a trifle nervously continued
the conversation:</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall have to prescribe a course of
Grimm&#39;s <i>Fairy Tales</i>, if you wish to resume
your position as story-teller-in-chief."</p>

<p class="indent">His speech was at random. The ice was
broken; they had spoken; he did not want
the coldness of silence to freeze it all over
again. Having got in the thin edge of the
wedge he proposed to drive it right home&mdash;if
possible. Hence his speech.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins laughed. The child liked him&mdash;so
did she. Fearful of driving her away, he
had not attempted to force conversation.
She had curled up a trifle because of his reserve&mdash;hence
they had spoken but little. Unknown
to themselves their communication had been
more subtle than that of words, perhaps had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
paved the way for them. They came easily
enough now.</p>

<p class="indent">"You also," he said, "seem to have a taste
for fiction of a pronounced type. I see you
are reading one of my books."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your books?" Her query was uttered
in a tone of surprise. "Oh, no! This came
down from Mudie&#39;s with other volumes
yesterday."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t doubt that."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed openly at her concern&mdash;a hearty,
resounding laugh, a trifle loud, but with a
pleasant honest ring in it; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t doubt that the library people
acquired it honestly. My claim was not made
in a possessory sense. I meant that my name
figures on the title page."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him blankly for a moment,
so great was her surprise. Then, the truth
dawning on her, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You! You&mdash;are the author?"</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE DANGER SIGNAL</h3>

<p class="indent">That she should meet a real live author,
the writer of the book she was reading,
was a coincidence strange enough to take
Miss Mivvins&#39; breath away. Masters saw
her wonderment, smiled at it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is the fact," he asked, "so difficult a
thing to reconcile with my appearance?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no, no! How awfully rude you
must think me! I meant&mdash;I mean&mdash;that I
expected the author of this book to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Then she paused. Did not quite know
what she expected or how to express herself;
added lamely:</p>

<p class="indent">"To be much older."</p>

<p class="indent">"Really! I am sorry I don&#39;t come up to
your age standard. Age has its privileges,
but wisdom is not always its perquisite. Why
should an author be necessarily old? Surely
youth is pardonable?"</p>

<p class="indent">She&mdash;a woman famous in her own particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
circle for the coolness of her tongue&mdash;could
have kicked herself. Was saying, in
her unwonted nervousness, all the things she
would rather have left unsaid. Angry with
herself, she blurted out:</p>

<p class="indent">"There is not, of course, any earthly reason
why. It was purely my utter stupidity."</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled at the flush on her cheek; a smile
conjured up by his admiration of it; said
merrily:</p>

<p class="indent">"Here have I been peacocking around,
with a sort of metaphorical feather in my cap.
Pampering my vanity, applying the flattering
unction to my soul&mdash;rubbing it in several
times per diem&mdash;that no author of my age
has turned out so many volumes. Lo! with
one breath you blow that feather clean away."</p>

<p class="indent">She could not resist laughing at his mock
despair. Became at her ease once more;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed not! I don&#39;t know what prompted
me to say what I did. As to this book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! Don&#39;t! Please don&#39;t give me your
opinion of it!"</p>

<p class="indent">His interruption was a continuance of his
burlesque melodramatic style. She did not
quite know how to take him; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean you would not value my
opinion?"</p>

<p class="indent">That was disconcerting. Sobered him in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
minute. He knew quite well the kind of
value he would be likely to put on any opinion
of hers&mdash;concerning himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no!" His answer was spoken earnestly.
"I do not mea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But she interrupted him. In her nervousness
felt that whilst her tongue was in action
it would help to keep the helm the right way;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Why should you? A stranger&#39;s opinion
would necessarily be valueless. You know
nothing of me."</p>

<p class="indent">The deafness of those who will not hear is
proverbial. The underlying earnestness in the
tone of his reply should have warned her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aren&#39;t you going just a trifle too far?" he
asked. "We are not quite strangers. True, I
know nothing of you&mdash;except that you are
Miss Mivvins."</p>

<p class="indent">An irresistible smile accompanied his words.
His smile&mdash;and his laugh too&mdash;were capable
of creating many friends. But he did not
allow them to. His views on the subject of
friendship were cynical in the extreme.</p>

<p class="indent">His smile was infectious. Once more those
alluring dimples which he had noticed at their
first meeting deepened in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is distinctly more my misfortune than
my fault," he continued, "that I know so
little of you. May I say&mdash;with an absence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
fear of your thinking me impertinent&mdash;that
I should like, much like, to know more of
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">The flush, that becoming flush, on her cheek
again. The eyes were fringed over by those
long lashes of hers as she cast them groundwards.
Just a blend of trouble in her look
as she queried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Really?"</p>

<p class="indent">He liked the pink showing on the white.
Colours inspire some men. Perhaps the combination
in her face inspired him. Anyway,
there was more vigour and determination in
his voice as he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">She, dallying, as a woman will, quite well
knew that there was a spark. That it would
burst into flame, chose she to fan it; gained
time by asking:</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">He vaulted on to his hobby horse. The
question was a stirrup helping him to the
saddle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;hail you in a
measure as a kindred soul."</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her eyes; he could not fail to
read the astonishment filling them; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are here in October, and you don&#39;t
look bored; don&#39;t look as if life held no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
further charm for you. You do not follow
the fashionable decrying of the place simply
because it is out of fashion&mdash;<i>because</i> it is
October."</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled. Encouraged by it, he continued,
in the same strain:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are always alone, yet you create the
impression that you are happy. You don&#39;t
seem to sigh for bands of music, to hanker
after a crowded promenade. You find existence
possible without a shoal of people to help
you pass your time."</p>

<p class="indent">Her smile broadened into a laugh. This
time at herself&mdash;at his description of her; she
asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"And those&mdash;shall I call them unusual?&mdash;characteristics
in a woman interest you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Amazingly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">She put the question with a little nervousness,
bred of that eagerness of his.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because&mdash;well, let me say by sheer force
of contrast. In those respects, Heaven be
thanked, you are not as other women."</p>

<p class="indent">The amused look had not left her face. It
lingered in the upward curve of the corners
of her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you prefer eccentric women, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">She could not resist just a trace of mischief
in the tone of her query. He answered:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
"Heaven forefend! I see nothing eccentric
in the attributes I have allotted to you. They
are refreshingly good to a thirsty soul."</p>

<p class="indent">The amusement and mischief tones left her
voice. She asked demurely:</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you thirsty?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Parched! I confess I am. I have just
escaped from the dead level of dry conventionality.
That arid desert: the Sahara of Society.
Its womenkind are my abomination."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked a little annoyed. As if not
appreciating his description.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have heard it rumoured, Mr. Masters,
that you fly from London to escape Society&#39;s
attentions."</p>

<p class="indent">"And for once the many-tongued is not a
lying jade. I suppose all of us, every man and
woman, are more or less eccentric."</p>

<p class="indent">"Put it that we, most of us, have bees in
our bonnets."</p>

<p class="indent">"Precisely. The buzzing of my particular
insect is the artificial life of modern Society.
I just loathe it; never go out for that reason.
Fly from London? Yes; I own up; I do.
As fast as an express can wing me. Fly to
escape the inanities with which the cup of
social life is overflowing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Balls, parties&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"And things of that sort are my pet horrors."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
She smiled at the expression of his disgust;
his manner of expressing it; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I seem to be shaking a red rag at a bull!"</p>

<p class="indent">"If," he continued, "Society is the product
of civilization I am an untutored savage.
Not an ungrateful one, mark you, but one
thankful for his savagery. Afternoon teas,
flower shows, and the hundred and one idiotic
things which go to make up the ordinary
every-day life in London ought to be abolished
by a drastic Act of Parliament."</p>

<p class="indent">Her smile merged into laughter. She had
gauged his capacity for exaggeration by this
time. The beginning of her understanding
of him was setting in. Her laugh over, she
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you are very drastic."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope not!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because if you think so, I have been mistaken.
I have formed a wrong estimate of
your character if you care for those things."</p>

<p class="indent">"And supposing I did? Would it be, think
you&mdash;unwomanly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"As the world wags? No. On the contrary.
The absolute quintessence of womanliness
in nine hundred and ninety-nine women
out of a possible thousand."</p>

<p class="indent">"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! that is it!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
"But if I did care for all and singular the
things you object to so much?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I should be sorry&mdash;really sorry&mdash;that I
had spoken as I have done."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because it would, must, savour of impertinence.
We, each of us, have a right to our
own opinions. I should just hate to think
that I have been forcing mine on any one; it
would be a painful thing. Opinions, like
boots, should fit the wearer&mdash;neither too narrow
nor too wide, and possibly an allowance for
stretching a point. To force an opinion would
be a modernized version of the iron boot the
torturers used to handle in the Inquisition
days."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you expressed yourself"&mdash;she smiled
at the recollection of it&mdash;"very strongly just
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I thought we were more or less
on the same plane; were thinking in common.
I hoped so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me, will you, why you thought me
different from other women: thought as you
did of me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, come! Isn&#39;t that now&mdash;don&#39;t you
think that rather hard on me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To put such a question as that. Calling
on me to tell you why I think."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
"Why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Think! If I could bring myself to lie
you would not like it. Yet, supposing I said
something to offend you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why should you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because of my ignorance. I would not
for worlds&mdash;knowingly. You would know
that I should not mean to."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, then. Why should I take
offence where none is intended?"</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated a moment. Plainly saw the
danger-signal flying; then he spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are a woman."</p>

<p class="indent">She tossed her head at that. There was no
mistaking the tone in which she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"There!... Proof positive! I won&#39;t speak;
I won&#39;t risk it. I am most anxious not to
offend you, and you shan&#39;t force my hand."</p>

<p class="indent">She tapped impatiently with the toe of her
shoe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>PLAYING WITH FIRE</h3>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins was annoyed; the impatient
tapping was evidence of it.
Not that a little exhibition of temper in any
way detracted from her personal appearance.
On the contrary, the air of petulance heightened
her charms.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are just like a man!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her speech was accompanied by another toss
of her shapely head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t that twisting things round? You
mean that he never gives a reason for what
he says or does?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Resumption of tattoo with her foot on the
ground. It made him exclaim:</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew I was right! What if I tell you
that I am a mind reader?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I would not be a bit surprised!"</p>

<p class="indent">He was: greatly. Could not understand
what she meant; queried:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
"You wouldn&#39;t?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am&mdash;to hear you say it. Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because in this book of yours I am reading"&mdash;she
held it up&mdash;"I see you believe in
palmistry."</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, come!" He was genuine in his
expostulation. "I make one of my characters
believe in it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you do not?"</p>

<p class="indent">She had him in a corner; was merciless.
He tried to wriggle out; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I did not say so."</p>

<p class="indent">It was an infecund effort on his part. She
pinned him in still further; was that kind of
woman.</p>

<p class="indent">"What does that mean? That you do
and you do not?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was nothing for him but to fence; he
answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes and No."</p>

<p class="indent">It did not in any way extricate him from his
difficulty. She continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are a complete enigma."</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no prize offered for the solution."</p>

<p class="indent">He endeavoured to speak lightly, to bring
the conversation back to the humorous line
it had left; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have known people take quite an interest
in enigmas. Do you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
She changed the subject. Kept away from
where there was a treading on dangerous
ground; felt the ice getting thin; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I gather that this palmist character of
yours professes to read the past, but does not
venture on prophecy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I venture on prophecy now!"</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke suddenly, rising as he did so.
Picking up his books, and&mdash;for the first time&mdash;quietly
possessing himself of her bag, continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"That rapidly travelling cloud, at present
looking very little larger than a man&#39;s hand,
coming from the south, is full of rain. It will
burst before we are back in the town, unless
we hurry. Gracie! Gracie!"</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl came running in response to
his call. All three, for the first time, walked
homewards together. A student of human
nature might have seen in it a beginning of
things.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am living in Marine Terrace."</p>

<p class="indent">He was describing the situation of his
lodgings. Waited for her to respond, and
then asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you far to go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, not so far as you have; little more than
half-way. Ivy Cottage; on the front. Do
you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"That pretty little bungalow with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
creeper over the porch? Before we reach
the big houses?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">He cast an eye over his shoulder at the still
distant cloud, gauging the time of its breaking;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"When the rain comes it will last, I fear.
That will mean confinement to the house."</p>

<p class="indent">"I fancy so, too. The local weatherwise are
predicting it also. You are not the only prophet.
&#39;Corns are shooting and roomatiz is
bad.&#39;"</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed at her excellent imitation of the
dialect ruling the language of the people; then
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"May I be personal? How are you off for
reading matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Mudie&#39;s have sent me down an
absolutely abominable selection. With"&mdash;a
twinkle escaped from the corner of her eye&mdash;"with
the exception of that one of yours."</p>

<p class="indent">"I won&#39;t gratify you with even a smile of
approval at so callous a joke," he said coolly.
"To trample on my feelings so is positively
inhuman. Still, that &#39;exception&#39; emboldens
me."</p>

<p class="indent">"In what way?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That finding you interested in one of my
books, I want you to let me&mdash;I want you to
favour me by accepting from me a set?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
"A set?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been guilty of five others." Mock
despair was in his tone. "Accept my contrite
apologies."</p>

<p class="indent">"Five others!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have to plead guilty to that number.
Heinous, isn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I did not mean that."</p>

<p class="indent">"And so young too!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Really, Mr. Masters!" The flush was
being worn again. "You are, really, too bad;
raking up old grievances!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I would like you to try and think there
is a substratum of good."</p>

<p class="indent">She ignored his speech, rather the significance
in the tone of its delivery; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I did not know&mdash;I confess openly, you
see. This makes but the third of yours I have
read."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then there is a possibility of interest being
left in the three you have not read. Let the
weather be my excuse for forcing them on
you."</p>

<p class="indent">"As if an excuse were needed! Pray do
not speak of your kindness so!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;I have some work I must finish
this afternoon for the post&mdash;may I bring them
to you this evening?"</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated a moment. Induced to do
so by a thought of the unwisdom of playing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
with fire. His hyper-sensitive nature made him
shrink from that hesitation, to nervously say:</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg your pardon. I mean I will make
a parcel of them and send them up to you."</p>

<p class="indent">The note of pain in his voice was so plain
that any question of her wisdom&mdash;or want of
it&mdash;vanished. She was moved to put her
hand on his arm; to say:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t deprive me of half the pleasure of
the gift. Please bring them yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">It was a pretty little speech. Prettily
spoken. No answering word came to his
lips, but the look of gladness in his eyes was
eloquent. Eloquent enough to make her
mentally pause again and ask herself: was
she acting altogether wisely?</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins was sailing under false colours.
Was not in a position to haul them down, or
fly her own. But she found him entertaining
and&mdash;and&mdash;and very pleasant to talk to. She
left it at that.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not afterwards remember much
of what they talked about on their walk along
the wall homewards. But she was conscious
of spending a very pleasant afternoon; that it
had passed away all too quickly. The most
entertaining conversations are usually those
which flow so smoothly that we forget to note
the landmarks and stepping-stones on the way.</p>

<p class="indent">She was in a quandary: dared not reveal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
to him her true self. She had learnt enough
of him to know that if she ran up her own
flag, one glance at the masthead would mean
his sheering right away.</p>

<p class="indent">She was not at all anxious that that should
happen; did not want to lose him. She had
grown to&mdash;to&mdash;to more than like him. Why,
she asked herself petulantly, why could he
not be as other men?</p>

<p class="indent">The rain held off till they reached her gate.
There they said good-bye, shaking hands for
the first time. The touch thrilled them both.
As an outcome he saw possibilities; felt what
their meeting might possibly lead to. It was
a pleasant feeling. Things were coloured by
it&mdash;colour of the rose.</p>

<p class="indent">Her good-bye was spoken lightly. Instinctively
she tried to counteract that thrill.
Yet there was a lingering tone in her voice as
she said, finally:</p>

<p class="indent">"Till eight o&#39;clock."</p>

<p class="indent">Then came Gracie&#39;s turn. He stooped
down, lifted and kissed her. She said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye, Prince Charlie. I shan&#39;t see
you in the evening because I go to bed at half-past
seven."</p>

<p class="indent">"My word! Half-past seven! How late
for a little girl to sit up!"</p>

<p class="indent">She exclaimed indignantly at so gross an
insult:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
"I&#39;m not a little girl! I&#39;m nearly five!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her indignation was a fleeting one. He
held her away; threw her up in the air till
she screamed with the delight of the pleasant
fear. Then caught and kissed her and set the
mite on her feet again.</p>

<p class="indent">So he dealt with the child. Then, raising
his hat, gave a final kindly smile in the direction
of the governess; nodded and said a final
good-bye.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was their parting. Each was full of
thoughts of the other. He walked home
wonderingly, thinking, why&mdash;for what reason&mdash;she
had said eight o&#39;clock. It sounded so&mdash;then
he laughed at his stupid thought.</p>

<p class="indent">So life touches life a moment, thrills and
bids it stay&mdash;as two drops of water in a peaceful
stream may touch for an instant and in
the next be parted by the waving reeds.</p>

<p class="indent">What of after meetings? Would they be
guided to one another by that strange fate
that we call Destiny?</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE REQUEST</h3>

<p class="indent">As a weather prophet Masters proved
more reliable than those who fill a
like mission on the daily papers.</p>

<p class="indent">It rained heavily all the afternoon. His
landlady when she brought in his tea remarked
that it was pouring cats and dogs&mdash;the
latter, presumably, of the Skye terrier breed.</p>

<p class="indent">A temporary clearance of the weather
came about in the evening. Masters was
glad; he went to Ivy Cottage. The bungalow-like
building was curiously situate in
its own square piece of grass land, fronting
the sea. The back of the house looked
on to the road leading to the railway station
a little distance away. Admission to the
cottage was gained by doors at back and
front of it.</p>

<p class="indent">The house agent entrusted with the letting
of the place had described it as possessed of
advantages not to be passed over lightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
There was one&mdash;an unsurpassed convenience
in the matter of not missing a train&mdash;that
certainly was undeniable and evident.</p>

<p class="indent">So close was the back of the house to the
railway that from the windows an approaching
train could be seen in time enough to allow
of easy walking to catch it. Masters walked
up the gravel path to the front door. Touched
the push of the bell.... A trim maid-servant
responded. He enquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Mivvins&mdash;is she within?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl started. Hesitated as she looked
at him closely&mdash;doubtfully&mdash;for a moment.
Then opened a side door in the hall, requesting
him to enter and be seated.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a charmingly arranged room to
which he was thus introduced. Evidenced
woman in every insignificant little detail;
her gentle touch was visible in all things.
He thought of the touch of one woman in
particular.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins&#39; spirit seemed to have impressed
itself in every fold of the curtains;
in all the quiet harmony of colouring; in
the inexpensive simplicity of the whole&mdash;as
distinct from cheapness.</p>

<p class="indent">Expensive simplicity often stamps the
quality of a room; it was not to be seen
here. There was nothing cheap about the
furnishing; nothing meretricious; nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
to catch the eye. Nothing of the enamel
paint and varnish description; all in that
apartment was plainly and simply what it
represented itself to be; its keynote: truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was astonished. Because he
had no idea that such signs of refinement
existed in Wivernsea. But then he knew
its lodging houses only&mdash;where the great god
is Aspinall and an uneasy chair the only
attempt at comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat some moments waiting. Whilst
doing so, he thought again of the curious
way in which the maid had looked at him.
Perhaps Miss Mivvins was in a less comfortable
place than he had thought. He had judged
by the freedom she enjoyed, that no possible
harm could result from his visit to her.
Was he wrong?</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps that accounted for her hesitation,
when he had suggested calling with the
books. What a fool he had been, not to think
of that! Perhaps she would get into trouble
by reason of his visit to her employer&#39;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">The more he thought of this the more
uncomfortable he became. As a result of
his deliberations, determined that he would
make his stay a short and formal one. There
could surely be no harm accrue to her from
that.</p>

<p class="indent">The rustle of a woman&#39;s dress warned him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
of her approach. Presently she entered. The
moment his eyes rested on her he was amazed:
she was dressed so perfectly. No scrap of
colour; no scintillation of a jewel.</p>

<p class="indent">He had a mere man&#39;s eye for woman&#39;s
dress&mdash;sensible of the tout ensemble, not of
detail&mdash;but he did not despise it. It seemed
fitting to him that graceful women should
be gracefully attired.</p>

<p class="indent">All harmony was grateful to his soul;
it did not seem unnatural for Miss Mivvins
to be gowned in accordance with her beauty.
Still he experienced astonishment, grave astonishment,
when she entered.</p>

<p class="indent">For the life of him he could not have
defined the impression which took hold of
him. But he knew that her gown was of
some soft, rich, silken, costly texture.
Resultant upon that was the belief that her
place must be an easier one than he had
begun to think it.</p>

<p class="indent">The extension of her hand to him. Once
more with it in his own, he felt thrilled.
That feeling and his previous resolve to hurry
away did not blend well. The thrill remained;
the resolve faded.</p>

<p class="indent">He produced the books he had promised
to bring with him. On the fly-leaf of each
he had written her name; beneath it had
appended his signature. So many people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
bothered him for autograph copies of his
books, that it was a pardonable vanity
if he had begun to think there was something
around his signature which enhanced the
value of his works. So he had penned the
words, <i>With kindest regards, from the Author</i>,
between her name and his own.</p>

<p class="indent">At sight of what he had written she laughed.
At first, gently; a gentleness which passed
into real hearty mirth. Then, catching sight
of his face, the laugh died away ashamedly!
Had she whipped him he could not have
looked more hurt. His hyper-sensitive
nature was suffering.</p>

<p class="indent">That laughter acted on Masters as if the
ceiling had opened and a shower of cold
water had fallen&mdash;his face showed it. To
be the subject of mirth was a novelty to him.
He was glad that that was so. Felt that
it was not a pleasant sensation to experience.
That a very little of it went an extremely long
way.</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed with annoyance at her own
rudeness; with shame for having wounded
the feelings of her visitor. He had not the
faintest idea why she laughed, of course;
want of knowledge so often leads to misunderstanding.
She said hurriedly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope you do not&mdash;oh, how can I explain
what I was laughing at? Mr. Masters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
don&#39;t, pray don&#39;t&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;think I
was rude&mdash;intended to be rude&mdash;or that I
was laughing at anything even remotely connected
with these books, which, believe me,
I shall always value, always prize."</p>

<p class="indent">That earnest humble little speech of hers
did not sponge away the look from his face.
In her eagerness to acquit herself she placed
her hand on his arm&mdash;it was for the second
time that day. It was a habit of hers when
moved. Was quite an innocent gesture; but
there was&mdash;in his estimation, anyway&mdash;a
distinct piquancy about its naturalness.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh&mdash;Mr. Masters!"</p>

<p class="indent">She got as far as that. Then stood at a
loss for words. She had spoken in such
dead earnest tones that it would have been
absurd to think her lying. Finding her
tongue again, she continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray, pray believe me! I was stupid,
I know, but don&#39;t be so hard as to think me
capable of insulting you. Don&#39;t! Please,
don&#39;t!"</p>

<p class="indent">His forgiveness was hers that moment.
The wonder remained what she could have
laughed at&mdash;but all else was forgotten. She
had looked into his eyes&mdash;a pretty woman&#39;s
trick, mostly always successful. When performed
with such eyes as Miss Mivvins&#39;
failure was absolutely impossible.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
"I don&#39;t think you rude. Don&#39;t think
you insulting. I could not think any ill
thing of you if I tried."</p>

<p class="indent">She had badly wanted to hear just some
such thing. But there was that in the tone
in which he spoke it that made her flush
again. She drew in her breath; drew back a
little.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am so glad!"</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins spoke impetuously&mdash;nervously.
She to be nervous! And that, too, in speaking
to such a boyish, ingenuous individual as
was Masters! It was quite too absurd! She
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I should not like you to think badly
of me."</p>

<p class="indent">She was obviously ill at ease&mdash;the obviousness
was the worst part of it. She knew that
herself; knew quite well. It was because
he believed in her! Because he trusted her
so implicitly; had an almost childlike faith in
her.</p>

<p class="indent">With all the other men she had known,
on whom she had exerted the power of her
fascination, her woman&#39;s ways and wiles had
seemed fair and fitting. They were but part
of the game, and understood by both sides of
it. The men had been men of the world&mdash;her
world&mdash;armed and armoured against her
coquetry and charm.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
Flirtation in those instances had been
carried to the point of a fine art&mdash;it was
part of the life she lived. But it had been
flirtation, pure and simple. Though it was
amusing enough while it lasted, it had been
fencing with blunt points.</p>

<p class="indent">No one had any wounds&mdash;not a scratch.
Experience had taught them all to play the
game skilfully. No one had been deceived
into taking things seriously. No soul was a
scrap the worse.</p>

<p class="indent">But Masters was of another world than
hers. Superficiality seemed unknown to him;
he put his heart into what he said and did.
Playing with life was evidently a thing unknown
to him; he was in earnest; always would be;
that was his temperament. Honest himself,
he believed her to be likewise.</p>

<p class="indent">What a character! Of course it appealed
to her&mdash;she would not have been a woman if
it had not. He would face her woman&#39;s
weapons&mdash;even her most innocent little deceptions&mdash;unsuspecting;
unarmed. To shower
on him the full force of her artillery would be
grossly unfair.</p>

<p class="indent">She was constrained to throw off the
conventional. To don the mantle of guilelessness&mdash;such
as he wore himself. He made it
impossible for her to act otherwise. But
the experience was quite a new one to her; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
was the novelty that made her nervous.
To be trusted&mdash;implicitly&mdash;was delightfully
disconcerting.</p>

<p class="indent">Her manner filled Masters with wonder.
The key to the mysterious nervousness was
not in his possession. Again there flitted
across his mind the idea that it arose from
his visit to her employer&#39;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">His resolution to stay but a little time
occurred to him. It would be best to go.
Yet he abhorred the idea of so speedy a
parting; if only he could&mdash;&mdash;He paused.
Thought a moment. Risked it; said
tentatively:</p>

<p class="indent">"The rain has ceased. It is damp below
but bright above."</p>

<p class="indent">A pause. His reference to the weather
seemed out of place. She did not know the
difficulty he was experiencing in screwing
his courage to the sticking place. He continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am walking to the end of the parade
and back."</p>

<p class="indent">Having voiced as much, his conversational
powers failed him. He somehow hoped
that she would suggest joining him in his
walk. That his ignorance of women was of
vast magnitude was evidenced by the nature
of that hope.</p>

<p class="indent">He was very transparent&mdash;so much so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
that there was no difficulty in guessing his
thoughts. She smiled. Ingenuousness was
scarcely the word for him! He should have
known the impossibility of her offering to
accompany him, however much she might
desire to do so. As she did not speak he
went even further, saying, with nervous
awkwardness:</p>

<p class="indent">"It is a warm evening&mdash;will you walk with
me?"</p>

<p class="indent">The smile left her face and her eyes opened
wide. She was startled at the suddenness
of his request. Still more at the nature of it.
Then remembered the nature of the man.
Felt too that there was owing to him something
for that unkind laugh of hers. Then
there was the trend of her own feelings!
After a moment she tossed discretion to the
winds; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be glad to&mdash;if you wish it!"</p>

<p class="indent">The words spoken, she was amazed at
their utterance. Her ready acquiescence
pleased him. It voiced that honesty he
thought so precious in her, which was so
sadly lacking in other women. He suspected
that another member of her sex would have
raised scruples, merely that he might flatter
himself that he had overcome them.</p>

<p class="indent">The absence of such coquetry in Miss
Mivvins was refreshing&mdash;refreshing as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
rays of the sun after electric light. So he
likened her womanhood to other women&#39;s.
He little knew what a whited sepulchre she
felt herself to be. His admiration of what she
did not possess positively hurt her.</p>

<p class="indent">Leaving the room for outdoor covering,
she presently returned with a long warm
cloak and her hat. Had got them from the
hall; came back with them over her arm.
Having agreed to accompany him, she lost
no time.</p>

<p class="indent">He assisted her to put on the cloak: an
expensive, fur-lined wrap. He could not but
notice that as, with trembling fingers&mdash;a
nervousness born of his touch of her&mdash;he
helped to button the garment down the
front.</p>

<p class="indent">Microbes multiply in darkness; sunlight
kills them. Her natural manner, open as
day, crushed the germ of suspicion. They
left the house and walked along the parade:
in the direction of the seat at the end of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>READING THE HAND</h3>

<p class="indent">The moon was now shining, now obscured.
A capricious, gusty wind played fantastic
tricks with dark clouds across its face. But
by the time the eastern end of the sea wall
was reached the Goddess of Night had risen
clear; was shining brightly. She silvered
and lighted up the rippling waters: jewelling
it as only the moon can.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall we rest for a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="indent">The suggestion was Masters&#39;. Not that
he was tired. But he had that on his mind
to unload, which he felt would be easier
of utterance sitting down.</p>

<p class="indent">They sat. After an awkward interval&mdash;she
was afraid to help him&mdash;he spoke again.
Not without difficulty. Love-making in
his novels he had found the easiest part of
his writing. He was finding reality a steed
of a totally different colour.</p>

<p class="indent">In an imaginative man it is possible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
imagination to be more real than reality;
just as a painting may give a truer impression
than a photograph. To Masters, just now,
reality seemed frigid and limited. He felt
himself bound; tied down to&mdash;and by&mdash;hard-and-fast
lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Then again there was the horrible uncertainty:
he was not sure. It was necessary
to feel his way. He had heard her laugh
once. He did not need a second edition of
that&mdash;with himself filling the rôle of laughee.
He had no desire to figure as a larger-sized ass
than was possible. Putting stripes on a
donkey does not make a zebra of it. He said
slowly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been here, to Wivernsea, regularly
for years past. Have sat on this seat
scores and scores of times. Now&mdash;I shall
never forget Wivernsea or this seat."</p>

<p class="indent">That was his heavily-shod method of
feeling his way; of nearly putting his foot
into it. She afforded him no fragment
of assistance; being a woman, of course
help was not to be expected of her. Woman
is an enigma; sympathetic to the point of
soft-as-silk, heart bleeding; yet there are
times when she finds pleasure in a man&#39;s
agony. Masters&#39; speech simply elicited the
query:</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
He gathered boldness from the sheer
impudence of her question. Felt that it
was impossible that she could have misunderstood;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall always link the place&mdash;and the
seat&mdash;with thoughts of you."</p>

<p class="indent">Her impudence had limits. She could not
affect to misunderstand that. Besides, the
accelerated beating of her heart warned
her. She must change the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">"The last time we were sitting here, Mr.
Masters, you hurriedly broke into the subject
of palmistry, with wise prophecies of bad
weather."</p>

<p class="indent">"Realized prophecies! Give me that
credit!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly; you deserve it! But tell me
now&mdash;quite seriously&mdash;do you believe in
palmistry?"</p>

<p class="indent">The dexterous turning of the subject annoyed
him. He was, however, compelled to
reply to her question; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Seriously? Well, to an extent&mdash;yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Really?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, don&#39;t think I go too far! Don&#39;t
for a moment suppose that I am pretending
that the geography of the future, mountains,
plains&mdash;the ups and downs of life&mdash;can be
studied from the map of the hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"And yet I have heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
"Charlatans profess to do so? Oh, yes;
scores of them. I can understand a nimble-witted,
half-a-guinea&mdash;or a guinea if she
can get it&mdash;Regent Street sibyl professing
so. That is fraud; absolute downright fraud.
But I believe that much of a man&#39;s or woman&#39;s
temperament, disposition, call it what you
will, can be plainly read from the lines of the
hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"Read mine."</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke impulsively. Persuasively too,
the while she pulled off her glove. Palmistry,
if it does not truly predict fate, is ofttimes
responsible for much of its direction.</p>

<p class="indent">To hold her warm little hand in his&mdash;she
had kept it close within the recesses of
her muff&mdash;was much too good an opportunity
to let slip. He bent over; spent quite a
time on the study of the lines on her palm.
He had only the light of the moon to work
by; perhaps that accounted for the time
expenditure; or perhaps he&mdash;well, anyway,
he was holding her hand all the while.</p>

<p class="indent">During the task&mdash;it was a silent one&mdash;he
was tempted, sore, to put his lips in the
warm centre of what he held. Possibly
she divined that; gathered it perhaps from
the trembling of his fingers as they grasped
her own. Stiffening a little, she queried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Her voice was as the application of a
brake; pulled him up. Tightening his hold
on himself he loosened his tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">"Temperament first," he answered. "Passionate&mdash;wilful&mdash;affectionate&mdash;hasty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The reading was wound up at that point.
The cataloguer paused, as it were, in the
middle of his list. In astonishment she
asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you stop? Is that all you can
read?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;no. But my belief&mdash;my faith&mdash;is
shaken!"</p>

<p class="indent">Just a faint tremor in the voice&mdash;it was
not unnoticed by him&mdash;as she asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith? In what?"</p>

<p class="indent">He fenced. Did not like to shape words
around what he thought he read. The
truth is not always pleasant. So it was that
he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Palmistry as a science."</p>

<p class="indent">The woman&#39;s voice was steadied again.
There was a ring of merriment in it, ridiculing
his seriousness, as she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Why this shaken faith? Because of what
you read in my hand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"M&#39;yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. What I have read&mdash;the indications&mdash;I
know to be wrong. This is a rude shock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
to my credence! I shall never again believe
in palmistry&#39;s infallibility!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me?"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke impatiently; her curiosity was
well aroused. Scrutinizing her hand with
interest; wholly disbelieving him, she said
imperatively:</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you read?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There seemed to be indicated characteristics
there, the exact opposite of those you
possess."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">She drew her hand away a trifle angrily:
obstinacy opposed to curiosity is as flint to
steel. Fingers, trembling a little, began
putting on her glove. The look in her
eyes could not be truthfully described as
softness; all the same it was very becoming.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not insensible of her feeling,
for the birth of which he was responsible.
Just restrained her: put his hand out on to
hers. A simple act, but one he performed
more gravely than the occasion warranted;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be angry."</p>

<p class="indent">Then hesitated; conscious, now he had
spoken, that the admonition&mdash;by presupposing
cause for it&mdash;was not likely to improve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
matters. Felt that he had put a large-sized
foot into it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Angry!"</p>

<p class="indent">The glitter in her eyes, as she repeated his
word, warned him that his intuition was
correct; made him say:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;annoyed."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are so&mdash;so provoking!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, you are not! You are not sorry a
little bit!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Believe me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you were sorry for your rudeness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rudeness!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes!"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke with a certain tone of defiance;
her anger blinding her to the fitness of things&mdash;he
was really but an acquaintance; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so. Tell me, what did you read?"</p>

<p class="indent">His silence incensed her more. Tapping
her foot impatiently at his manifest reluctance
to answer, she went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"What does it matter? You say you read
the exact opposite of the truth."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you insist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She was in buckram in a moment; pride
stiffened her. Drawing herself up, she interrupted
him; spoke with an imperious little
gesture:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
"Oh, no! I have no right to do that. I
merely asked."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins rose to her feet: a woman&#39;s
way of terminating an interview. In his
sorrow&mdash;disappointment&mdash;once more he
touched her hand restrainingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please sit down."</p>

<p class="indent">The note of pleading sounded in his voice.
Then&mdash;surely his good angel whispered him
which line to strike out&mdash;he added:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go yet. You are right&mdash;I was
wrong."</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A SOFT GOOD NIGHT</h3>

<p class="indent">Masters took his stand on that apology
and made capital out of it. Miss
Mivvins resumed her seat. With all his
ignorance of the treatment women expected&mdash;out
of books&mdash;he had acted in strict consonance
with the sex&#39;s idea of the fitness of
things.</p>

<p class="indent">To own up to the rightness of the woman
you are talking with, and your own wrong, is
as oil to machinery. It is an almost infallible
way of worming yourself into the woman&#39;s
good graces; rarely fails. Its lack of truth
is compensated for by its success: the
Jesuitical theory that the end justifies the
means.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why I said the exact opposite, was
because in your hand there are lines"&mdash;he
was holding her hand in his now; holding it
tightly as if he did not want it to slip away
again&mdash;"which signify love of
admiration&mdash;society&mdash;entertainment&mdash;jewels&mdash;riches&mdash;luxury&mdash;noise&mdash;bustle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
and excitement."</p>

<p class="indent">She listened to the catalogue in silence&mdash;save
for the eloquence of the lashes of her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"And if," she queried after a moment, "if
I confessed to all that&mdash;that you had read
correctly&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled, so certain was he of the falsity
of his catalogue: that her character was very
different from his delineation.</p>

<p class="indent">"At the risk of your again calling me rude,"
he answered, "I should say you were speaking
falsely."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because in Nature&#39;s library there is a
more truthful book to read than that of the
hand&mdash;the face."</p>

<p class="indent">She started; he had commenced the perusal
of what he referred to. Her slight blush was
hidden; a kindly cloud passed over the moon
at the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have read that face of yours&mdash;read it
again and again. I read it each time I see
you, I read it even when I do not see you;
your face is never away from me now."</p>

<p class="indent">His voice had grown very soft. Having
taken his courage in both hands he made the
first real movement in their little comedy.
There followed on his speech a slight pause&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
interval filled in, as it were, by the provision
of accompanying music: the rippling
surge.</p>

<p class="indent">She essayed to draw her hand away&mdash;not
putting too much heart in the attempt. He
needed to make no superhuman effort to be
successful in its retention.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know that you are the cause of
my destruction of three-fourths of a story
I have written?"</p>

<p class="indent">Her astonishment at his utterance was due
to the fact that she did not at all understand
him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I? Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The day we met here&mdash;a red-letter day
in the calendar of my life&mdash;when first we sat
together on this seat, I was dissatisfied with
the heroine I was creating: she was not good
enough. You came; I put you in my book;
put you in the place of the creation I had been
dissatisfied with&mdash;the study from life was so
much better. And it was so simple; I never
had to wander or imagine things about her.
She was always&mdash;is always&mdash;before me."</p>

<p class="indent">She persisted in her affected disregard&mdash;a
poor sort of performance&mdash;of the meaning in
his voice; asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"How have you painted her&mdash;me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Unsophisticated, ingenuous, frank, guileless.
She comes into the life of a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
has lived away from women, who has never
believed in them, never wanted to. She
makes the man see the error of his ways;
leads him out of the darkness and blackness
of his night into the brightness of her day.
She becomes his sun."</p>

<p class="indent">His words, the manner of their utterance,
made her bosom rise and fall. The deep
earnestness in his voice would have moved a
much harder heart than hers.</p>

<p class="indent">"And he?"</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes lighted up as, in reply to that
question, he began a sort of description of
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"He thanks God for the light! Lives!
Lives! Sees things in life he never saw
before. She has thrown a searchlight on the
barrenness of his solitude: shown him its
poverty. He realizes that it is not good for
man to live alone."</p>

<p class="indent">An onlooker just then would have imagined
her sole object in life to be the boring of a
hole in the tarred path. She was watching
her toe at work with an engrossment of the
most, apparently, intense kind.</p>

<p class="indent">"And all this&mdash;these ideas&mdash;were born of
my&mdash;our&mdash;chance meetings?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes! My work became easier; there
was no labour. Your face was as a book to
me; an open book. I just seemed to copy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
from it what was written there. But as for
chance&mdash;who can say? Chance is but unseen
direction."</p>

<p class="indent">The caress in his voice made itself felt.
Ignoring the latter part of his speech she
made hurried reply:</p>

<p class="indent">"And you read all this in my face? My
face which contradicts my hand so?"</p>

<p class="indent">So earnest was he, that he grew almost
petulant over the wilful misunderstanding,
her changing of the subject; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Let the reading of the hand go. I am
content with the face."</p>

<p class="indent">Looking up, she realized that his eager eyes
were fixed earnestly on her. Saw in them the
smouldering fire waiting for the smallest
draught to lick it into flame.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you reading it now? Don&#39;t you
know"&mdash;with a nervous little laugh&mdash;"that
it is very rude to stare so?"</p>

<p class="indent">He felt reminded of the action of an
engine&#39;s piston: his heart was pumping so
furiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t," he urged. "Please don&#39;t say so.
It would wipe out half the happiness of your
presence if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">That eagerness of his must be checked!
There was no knowing how far it would lead!
She stepped behind the lattice of conventionality.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
"It is growing late." She was on her feet;
used the interview terminator again. "We
must be returning."</p>

<p class="indent">He drew in his breath; was so afraid.
Struggled in vain to control his rebellious
pulse; fancied he had gone too far. Tried
to retrace his steps and found&mdash;as most of us
do&mdash;walking backwards gracefully to be a
matter difficult of performance.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have not offended you by speaking as I
have done, the truth?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Offended!"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke shortly. Just repeated his word,
not being in a mood for the making of long
speeches; added:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh no!... Now let us be going."</p>

<p class="indent">They went. Homeward bound the conversation
perched on stilts; seemed artificially
out of reach; a reserve had sprung up
between them. Both were making obvious
efforts to be natural. Masters was appreciative
of the fact that his own were a sickly
failure.</p>

<p class="indent">At her gate she assumed merriment; a
transparent, fraudulent kind of mirth. Said
laughingly, one hand on the latch, the other
ready to place in his:</p>

<p class="indent">"And now, Mr. Prophet, what of the
morrow? Think you will it hail, rain, wind
or snow?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
It was not infectious, that merriment of
hers. She had fallen on the first subject in
Valapuk: the weather. Staple of English
intercourse, how many can deny it a debt of
gratitude? Common ground&mdash;a national
heritage whereon we can disport ourselves
at ease.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rain, I am afraid." He looked round.
"Those banks of clouds augur badly."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are not a comforting sort of prophet!
Assumption of your correctness means confinement
to the house all day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her as he answered. The
glance made it hardly a laconic reply....
She stretched out her hand. With the light
in her forget-me-not eyes full on, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">Taking her hand&mdash;his retention of it was
for a period considerably longer than is considered
quite good form in Mayfair&mdash;he
asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"If a wet day&mdash;to-morrow, you know&mdash;I
shall not see you at all, shall I?"</p>

<p class="indent">Those eloquent lashes of hers helped her
speech as she replied:</p>

<p class="indent">"It may clear in the evening, as it did
to-day. I may not take Gracie out in the
damp. But, unless it rains, I shall take my
own walk in the evening."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
Even a smaller mercy would have made him
thankful. He enquired eagerly:</p>

<p class="indent">"At eight o&#39;clock?"</p>

<p class="indent">The fringes lifted, giving him what he
extravagantly labelled a glimpse of Heaven.
In the moonlight he saw all the glory of her
eyes, as she answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">He had never thought it possible that room
could be found for so delightful a tone in a
woman&#39;s voice, as was in Miss Mivvins&#39;
utterance of that one-syllable word.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you should find me walking on the
parade at that time," he suggested, "you&mdash;you
would not be displeased?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him again. What she read
prompted her to think him deserving some
little reward. Casting her eyes down to her
hand, which he was still holding, and lowering
her voice too, till it was almost a half-whisper,
she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"What&mdash;what would you think if I said
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated&mdash;stopped. Quite eagerly he
endeavoured to help her on; interjected:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That I might be disappointed if I did not
see you?"</p>

<p class="indent">The sigh he drew was of a plumbless nature.
He answered, his soul in his utterance:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
"You will not be disappointed."</p>

<p class="indent">The sweetest of sweet tones, speaking in the
low, tremulous voice which may say so little
but mean so much:</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-night!"</p>

<p class="indent">A grip of her hand that almost hurt her;
a light in his eyes which had never found place
there before, and he echoed her final words:</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-night!"</p>

<p class="indent">Softness in both their voices, in their whole
manner. A reciprocated hand pressure.</p>

<p class="indent">So they parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>OVER THE GARDEN WALL</h3>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins was very full of thought
of the man who had left her; he was
full to the point of over-brimming of thought
of her. They were soulful thoughts, which
lasted them both till sleep closed the windows
of their souls.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of the man the eyelids remained
wide open till the grey dawn flushed rosily
before the rising sun. Even then he dreamt:
of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, when he awoke, it was evident that
a halo of success would surround his weather
prophecy. His prediction of wet turned out
correct: it rained nearly all day. But Cupid
must have bribed Pluvius; the rain ceased to
fall as the grey of evening closed down on the
day.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they met again. It was a walk only;
a walk up and down the front. She did not
feel equal to trusting herself on that seat
again. Did not trust him&mdash;or herself.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
A moonlight night, a murmuring sea and a
man with eyes of greater eloquence than his
tongue possessed&mdash;decidedly she thought it
was best to avoid sitting down.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mivvins did not altogether seem herself;
was nothing like so bright as she had
been before. The sweet mouth never parted
in laughter once during all the walk. It was
a new mood to him; one in which he could
find no pleasantness.</p>

<p class="indent">He taxed her with it; something was
worrying her. He would have liked to plainly
ask what, that he might lighten or at least
share the trouble. She, not admitting it,
endeavoured to shake off the depression.</p>

<p class="indent">As their good-byes were uttered, he exhibited
a surprising fertility in the invention of
hints of meetings again. She, for reasons
known to herself, did not take them.</p>

<p class="indent">The weather afforded her a shield; she
switched the conversation on to that. Clouds
were shaping ominously; there was a prospect
of more foul weather on the breaking of the
morrow. So was avoided any open reference
to another evening walk when they parted.</p>

<p class="indent">Clouds, of another kind, seemed to envelop
him. He had counted so on the meeting;
had watched the ticking away of the hours
till the fall of eventide: and after, till eight
o&#39;clock came.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
All the warmth of the previous evening, all
his delicious anticipation, was eclipsed by the
frigidity of to-night. He felt like one for
whom the sun has set while it is yet day.</p>

<p class="indent">He worried himself to the point of haggardness:
being a man possessed of strong
emotions. Walked home mind-laden with
fear that he had done or said something to
offend her. Racking his brain, yet failed to
find a record; could not imagine what had
been his sin.</p>

<p class="indent">His slumber was not of the peaceful kind.
Although his dreams were of her&mdash;the woman
his waking thoughts were so full of&mdash;they
were not of the pleasant kind of yesternight.
Again, too, he saw the red fringe in the east
grow into dawn before he slept.</p>

<p class="indent">A warm, drizzling rainy day; so he found
the weather on awaking. So warm that at
breakfast he had his window open; his landlady
referred to the condition of things as
being muggy. That was not the only speech
of hers he heard that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The proverb about listeners and the good
things they hear occurred to him. By reason
of the open window he was unable to avoid
overhearing a conversation. It was carried
on between the next door landlady and his
own.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters would have scorned a suggestion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
eavesdropping. He was aroused from the
depths of the morning paper, in the columns
of which he was immersed, by hearing his own
name spoken. That is usually a call to
attention to most of us. The voice of the
neighbour reached him:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. My Liza saw &#39;em walking together,
so to speak. Lord, &#39;e don&#39;t look a gent like
that, do &#39;e? But you never know, do you?
As I was only sayin&#39; to Mrs. Robinson this
very mornin&#39;, quiet ones is always the wust.
She&#39;s a &#39;ot lot, and no mistake!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure it was my lodger?"</p>

<p class="indent">The inquiry was from his own landlady.
He recognized her voice, low pitched as it
was: there were top notes in it she could
never eliminate. The answer came over the
garden wall:</p>

<p class="indent">"My Liza ain&#39;t a fool, I give you my word!
There, as I says, you never know, do you?
It don&#39;t always do to judge by &#39;pearances.
Your ground floor looks as if butter wouldn&#39;t
melt in his mouth, as the sayin&#39; is. But she&mdash;there!
You can tell with &#39;alf-an-eye what
she is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I s&#39;pose there ain&#39;t no mistake
about that. Fine feathers don&#39;t always make
fine birds."</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s going about, in a manner of speaking,
plainly dressed too, just now. Ev you noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
it? I see her with my own eyes in Juggins&#39;
shop without a single ring on her finger! She
as used to ev a &#39;alf-dozen sparkling di&#39;monds
on each &#39;and."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pawned &#39;em, perhaps."</p>

<p class="indent">"No fear! She knows your lodger&#39;s well-to-do,
and she&#39;s working &#39;im for all &#39;es wuth,
as the sayin&#39; is. Lor! She&#39;s up to snuff, I
can tell you. As I was sayin&#39; to Mrs. Smith,
them kind of women is up to every thing."</p>

<p class="indent">A voice, presumably the tones of the afore-mentioned
Liza, broke in. The next door
neighbour was being called; some one was
enquiring about lodgings. The conversation
ended with the suddenness of an eye&#39;s
twinkling.</p>

<p class="indent">Little as Masters had heard, he was the
whole day trying to digest it. Material for
thought was there: a pregnancy of horrible
suggestions.</p>

<p class="indent">As to his work, he did not write a line;
could not read a paragraph. After the manner
of a caged beast walked up and down the
room. When at last he sat, sheer exhaustion
was the compelling force.</p>

<p class="indent">His mid-day meal was turned over on his
plate; any idea of eating it was out of the
question; it was taken away practically
untouched. He had no room for physical
food; he was so very full just then of mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
provender. One dominating thought reigned
over all others. What should&mdash;what could
he do?</p>

<p class="indent">His habit was to drink a cup of tea in the
early afternoon. His landlady entered bearing
a little tray. Whilst she was spreading
its contents, the thoughts consuming him
found vent. He said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go away&mdash;for a moment. I want
to ask you something."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know Ivy Cottage&mdash;on the front?
Do you know who lives there?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him for a moment before
answering. An autumn bird needs careful
handling; if it takes flight the nest remains
empty till the following summer. She passed
her tongue over the thin lips which framed it;
said warily:</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir. That is to say, not their present
names."</p>

<p class="indent">Memory&#39;s finger pointed out the conversation
of the morning over the garden wall;
this woman&#39;s share in it. He knew she was
lying. His anger against things in general
was smouldering; something to let it loose
on would be a relief. Why this deceit and
mystery?</p>

<p class="indent">The wisdom of keeping his foot on the
brake was known to him. He was wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
enough, too, to grasp the fact that a man in a
temper weakens his armour. There was
battle to be done; he meant having it out
before the woman left his room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that altogether correct?" he inquired.
"Surely you must, living in this place, have
heard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!"</p>

<p class="indent">Exclamation with a vinegary shake of
her head. She was standing now with her
mittened hands crossed, prepared evidently
for a long talk; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"We hear plenty about them, sir!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know the master of the house?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not the present one, sir&mdash;if there is one
just now!"</p>

<p class="indent">In shaping the deep lines round her mouth
his satanic majesty had surely held the
graver! Masters thought the meaning smile
with which she let loose the innuendo positively
hideous in its suggestiveness. His
inflammable emotions rendered it difficult for
him to get proper control of his voice as he
enquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"The mistress, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">Impatience in the tone of his voice. He
had hoped to elicit replies without this direct
inquiry. Felt ashamed of himself the while
he probed. It was not a feeling the woman
shared. She answered:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
"Oh, yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">The readiness of her answer was apparent.
She was the kind of woman to whom slander
was a dainty morsel to be tongue-rolled. Her
own tongue became as the pen of a ready
writer. It sickened the questioner, but he
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"And the governess?"</p>

<p class="indent">Vigorous shaking of the woman&#39;s head
again. In the same redolent-of-sourness style,
too, as she answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no governess there, sir. The
only servints is the cook and &#39;ousemaid and
the odd boy."</p>

<p class="indent">He knew that to be a lie! Hope, that he
had thought entombed, rose again. One
thing incorrect, why not all? He said
sharply:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are mistaken!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think so, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Again that hideous smile. Accompanied
this time by a pitying expression; pity for his
simplicity! He was like the generality of
men&mdash;writhed under pity. It acted on him
with the irritation of a rasp. He, however,
controlled himself sufficiently to enquire:</p>

<p class="indent">"A tall, fair, blue-eyed young lady?"</p>

<p class="indent">The description elicited a second edition of
the pity&mdash;third of the head shaking&mdash;as the
woman answered:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
"That&#39;s the mistress, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">It is difficult to keep a watchful eye ever on
the safety valve. The indignation within
him was seething to boiling point. He was
getting up steam so rapidly as to create the
impression that his emotions were arranged
on the principle of the tubular boiler. He
blurted out:</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you, you are wrong! Her name is
Miss Mivvins!"</p>

<p class="indent">Combination of every unpleasant wrinkle
that the human face is capable of assuming,
as she replied, with the incisiveness of a
knife cut:</p>

<p class="indent">"Very likely that&#39;s one of her names, sir!
Now I come to remember, I did once in a
shop &#39;ear her called so&mdash;called so by her own
child."</p>

<p class="indent">That was the last straw! the safety valve
was discarded. He blurted out:</p>

<p class="indent">"Her&mdash;own&mdash;child!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. The little girl who&#39;s always with
her. The one with the carity &#39;air as some
people calls orebin."</p>

<p class="indent">Amazement! Consternation! Disappointment!
A combination of these feelings, and
many other indescribable ones, made him
break out with:</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;then she is married?"</p>

<p class="indent">All the subtle devilish suggestions in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
came to the surface. To emphasize the
point of her answer, slow head-shaking was
necessary:</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn&#39;t say as to that, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled too that horrible smile again!
The desire to speak evil of others assails some
natures irresistibly. She really could not
resist&mdash;October lodger or no lodger.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you. That will do."</p>

<p class="indent">He managed to dismiss her so, and the
landlady left the room. She was fearful of
having gone a little too far; yet was filled
with the complacency with which such
utterances&mdash;to such natures&mdash;is fruitful.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, he was alone&mdash;but such a loneliness!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE LITTLE WINGED GOD</h3>

<p class="indent">The closing of the door behind his landlady
was unheard by Masters. He
did not move from the position in which the
woman had left him for many, very many
minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">When at last he rose, lifting his head, he
caught sight of his own reflection in the
mirror. Started back, almost cried out:
there was such a deathly pallor covering his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">His mouth felt as parched as Sahara.
Mechanically he mixed a whisky and soda:
drank it off. Then laughed. Not a pleasant
mirth; one of those built up on a sob.</p>

<p class="indent">Then self-raillery: the old, old, ever
sought useless salve. What a fool! What
a fool he was to care! A woman! Just as
he had always pictured them&mdash;always till
the book he was now engaged on. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
thought how chaste and good and pure his
last heroine was, on paper, he laughed
again. The same laugh; with the same
choking painful little catch-in-the-throat in it
too.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought he had lost his ideals long ago;
we are apt to flatter ourselves so. But their
death is hard; they live on&mdash;unknown even
to ourselves&mdash;to appear before us like some
new star of whose existence we know nothing.
Make it our guiding star, and we are&mdash;when
it sinks below the horizon of fate&mdash;as children
crying in the night.</p>

<p class="indent">The mantel clock chimed seven times.
Masters&#39; attention was thereby drawn to the
fact that it was half-past that hour. Lodging-house
clocks are not without their peculiarities;
the fulfilled ambition of this particular
one was to be half-an-hour behind
time.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters started, too, at the sound. Memory
of his neglected work came to him. Lying
on his desk was a bundle of corrected galley
proofs, which should have been posted to his
publisher. Now it was too late: the post
bag would be made up.</p>

<p class="indent">He was annoyed that he had allowed the
incident&mdash;he was miserably failing in trying
to label it so to himself&mdash;to interrupt the
routine of his work. Another glance at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
clock and he kicked off his slippers and horned
on his shoes.</p>

<p class="indent">Putting on a cap, fastening his greatcoat
as he went, he hurried railway stationwards.
For all the thickness of his coat he was not
warm. There was a coldness around his
heart as if it were icebound.</p>

<p class="indent">The last up-train left at eight o&#39;clock.
In October the passengers made no great
demand on the guard&#39;s attention; in the
season he might have been, with justness,
likened to a sardine packer. Entrustment
of the bundle of proofs, to be posted by the
railway man on arrival in London, was an
easily arranged matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Crossing the hand with a piece of silver
is as effective with the average guard as it is
with a gipsy: the oracle is worked thereby.
The proofs would reach the publisher by first
post in the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters had effected this arrangement by
five minutes to eight; five minutes before
the scheduled time for the train&#39;s departure
for London. Having lighted a cigar in the
shelter of the waiting-room doorway, he
buttoned up his coat, prepared for his return
walk home.</p>

<p class="indent">As&mdash;buttoned up, cigar in mouth&mdash;he
emerged from the station&#39;s precincts, he could
not fail to observe the lights in the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
windows of Ivy Cottage. The bungalow
stood not three minutes&#39; walk away.</p>

<p class="indent">That he should have avoided, he knew;
but the night was dark; he would not be
seen. Moreover, he was in no way different
from other moths who ever flutter round
candles.</p>

<p class="indent">So, more or less unconsciously, he was
attracted; slowly walked in the direction
of the light. The little god with wings is as
experienced in the use of the magnet as the
dart.</p>

<p class="indent">The corner of the road, which the rear of
the house faced, was reached. Suddenly the
back door of the house was opened. By
the light in the passage behind he saw a man
and a woman silhouetted in the door-frame,
evidently engaged in actions of a farewell.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman had her arms lovingly round
the man&#39;s neck. She fervently kissed him&mdash;his
lips&mdash;again and again. Her sorrow at
the parting was apparently of the deepest
kind; at times she applied her handkerchief
to her eyes. Not a detail of the incident
escaped the attention of the man in the
road.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters stood quite still watching them.
Not an act due to ill-breeding: he was for
the moment simply incapable of movement.
Had his existence depended on a forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
step, Death would have added another name
to his list.</p>

<p class="indent">The couple came out in the garden;
walked towards the gate. The path led
straight from the door; the hall lamp still
showed him the positions: the woman&#39;s
arms clinging around the man.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well he stood in the shadow on that
road; well that they were so occupied as to
prevent their noticing him. Perhaps the
iron that had entered into his soul travelled
viâ his face. That would account for the
seared look on it. It was as the face of the
dead.</p>

<p class="indent">So different. Ah! So different had he
thought her. Had linked up, in his mind,
the purity of the snow in connexion with
her. This was the woman he had pictured;
who was ever so before him that his pen
seemed animated when he handled it to
describe her.</p>

<p class="indent">His thoughts&mdash;edged with keen bitterness
and self-contempt&mdash;went back to the pure,
guileless heroine in his book. Had he been
capable of laughter at himself, for being a
fool, his mirth would have been of the greatest
heartiness just then.</p>

<p class="indent">The couple at the gate parted; the watcher
was not very clear how. What followed
being&mdash;by reason of a sort of indescribable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
veil or mist which enveloped him&mdash;blurred,
almost hidden from him. Dazed as was his
condition, he was cognizant that the man
crossed the road, ran past up the pathway
to the station. Then came the sound of a
whistle, followed by the rumbling of the
departing train.</p>

<p class="indent">Footsteps! He knew them&mdash;short as had
been his acquaintance with them&mdash;along the
gravel path; then the door of Ivy Cottage
was shut. The blackness of the night could
not have been heavier than the thoughts
he was alone with. Ideas of things seemed
to grow more entangled and confused every
instant.</p>

<p class="indent">From the moment that he had despatched
his parcel, he had been mentally accusing
himself of folly of the highest class. Did so
whilst lighting his cigar and on the way from
the booking office&mdash;with the back of Ivy
Cottage fronting him. Why had he believed
those wretched over-the-wall gossips, when
there was the face&mdash;those soulful eyes&mdash;of
the woman herself to look into?</p>

<p class="indent">That he had listened to and questioned
his landlady was an insult to the woman
of whom his mind was so full. He knew how
those glorious, plumbless blue eyes of hers
would flash contempt for him did she but
know: she must never know! Standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
there&mdash;near the house which enshrined what
he thought the dearest and best in the world&mdash;he
almost cursed himself. For his folly in
doubting her. His future faith should obliterate
the memory of that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Then&mdash;then the back door had opened!
It was a shock; a horrible shock. But there
was confirmation of what he had been told.
The scales fell from his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Minutes&mdash;they seemed to him centuries&mdash;passed.
The mist before his eyes cleared
away; the veiling disappeared. But he felt
that it would not be a display of wisdom to
turn homewards, just yet.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was a sensitive&mdash;hyper-sensitive is
perhaps a better word&mdash;man. To rub up
against inquiries from a garrulous landlady
as to his health would prove more irritating
than sand paper. He knew that his appearance
would provoke comment; felt how he
looked; determined to try and walk the
look off.</p>

<p class="indent">By setting his face eastward, continuing
on the station road for a mile or so, he would
come out on the shore at what was known
as The Gap. By walking along the sands
therefrom, past the private owner&#39;s wall, he
would be able to mount to the parade by the
steps which faced his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Lips tightened and his fingers clenched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
when he remembered the reference to this
as "our" seat. The walk would do him
good; he laughed a little at that last idea.
As if, he thought, anything in the whole world
would ever do him any good again!</p>

<p class="indent">Shaken faith is a wound that smarts
acutely; the only surgeon able to apply a
salve is Time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE VOICE IN THE DARKNESS</h3>

<p class="indent">It was a fitful night; one on which the
clouds travelled swiftly. One moment
the brightness of a silvering moon; the next
comparative darkness. When the extinguishers
hid the lamp of night, the illumination
of the heavens was left to the stars.</p>

<p class="indent">There was sufficient light for Masters to
find his way over the breakwaters without
stumbling. At times, though, despite the
brightness of the moon, his eyes saw dimly.
With a swiftness bred of anger he knuckled
the dimness away, cursing his own irrepressible
folly the while.</p>

<p class="indent">His heart&mdash;soul&mdash;was full to bursting point.
If he could only laugh, he thought; only
laugh at himself! What an immense, great
big thing it would be!</p>

<p class="indent">Walking, smart walking, was the only
relief he experienced; physical exertion was
reputedly an antidote to mental excitement.
He felt sufficient energy to have moved on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
indefinitely. Wished he could walk on till
he fell from exhaustion. In that there would
have been satisfaction; rest, at any rate.
Rest from that tumultuous tide of recrimination
surging in his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">His anger was directed against himself;
no one else. It upsprung from the fact that
he had been such a fool, such an utter,
absolute fool, as to be gulled by a woman!
Scoffingly he told himself that anger against
her would be unfair; that her behaviour
had been merely typical of her sex!</p>

<p class="indent">He, who had ever with his pen written
against womankind&mdash;until at last reviewers
had spoken of his work as being that of a
woman-hater&mdash;to have fallen such an easy
victim to the first siren who spread her snare
for him! The thought was fuel to the
maddening fever in possession of him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came before him her face; those
sweet, eloquent, soulful eyes! Well, he
endeavoured to comfort himself with the
thought that any man would have fallen a
victim as he had done. The amount of
comfort in it, though, would have found
resting-place on a needle&#39;s point.</p>

<p class="indent">There was an underlying reason for the
failure. Granted that his ideal was shattered,
he still loved its ruins. Therein lay
the hopelessness of it all&mdash;and he knew it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Striding on, he savagely kicked out of his
way, now and then, a stone. Poor sort of
relief again.</p>

<p class="indent">The configuration of the coast line brought
him to an abrupt standstill. The cliff, jutting
out, was met by a barrier of high rocks.
These latter were overgrown with seaweed
of the slipperiest sort: defiance bidding.
Nature&#39;s sudden intervention in his proceedings
produced a corresponding interruption
in his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">Why should he think about this woman
any longer? She was not worth wasting
thought over. He had been happy enough
without her&mdash;before he knew her. So he
would be happy without her still.</p>

<p class="indent">Cut the thought of her clean out of his
mind; out of his heart. That, he told
himself, was the correct thing to do. Life
should be for him as if he had never seen her,
never looked into the unfathomable depths
of those forget-me-not eyes. It would be
quite easy; a little effort of will was needed&mdash;that
was all.</p>

<p class="indent">All that he meant; every word of it.
Framed a resolution that he looked on as
adamantine. But he ignored an important
factor; made no allowance for the strange
vitality of that prolific pure white flower:
Love.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
The axe of common sense may be laid to
the root of the tree; may cut it down root
and branch. Still one small remaining tendril,
hidden from the sight, will work its way
into the heart; spread and grow until in
its magnitude it overshadows every other
thought. Such is love.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters reached the steps which led up
from the sands to the seat. Standing at
their base, he looked away in the direction
of the sea. It was easy to mark the spot
where Gracie had worked so hard with spade
and pail.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought of the child with a pang of
pity. For his heart had gone out to her;
he had been captivated by her loving, winsome
ways. Even now his eyes rested on where
Gracie had built her last castle. He could
mentally see her gleesomely watching the
waters overflowing the moat and gradually
sweeping down the castle&#39;s inverted pail-shaped
turrets.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie! Poor little soul! And so she,
whom he had mistaken for the governess&mdash;this
woman&mdash;was the mother of that incarnation
of innocence and purity! What of
the child&#39;s future? He shuddered to think
of it; it was horrible; all horrible in the
extreme.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, he would go home to his lodgings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
First he would look again&mdash;for the last time&mdash;on
that portion of the sands. For he felt
that he would never be able to come there
again. He would have been thankful for
a breeze just then: his brow was feeling so
fevered.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps there was more air on the seawall;
he would test it, pass up the steps.
There was the seat to avoid looking at; the
seat whereon they had both sat reading&mdash;heart
reading heart. Where had been born
to him the happiest moment in life: love&#39;s
awakening.</p>

<p class="indent">There was other history about the seat
too: pencil created. Thereon, before that
meeting, had been born heroes and heroines,
wicked men and wicked women. All to be
bound together and pressed between covers
later on, to gladden or sadden readers&#39;
hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">Living a romance is less alluring than
writing one: Masters found it so. He had
been wont to believe in the parts he cast
his characters for. He was learning!</p>

<p class="indent">Stumbling up the steps on to the wall,
he started to walk home. But he halted,
suddenly, before he had taken half-a-dozen
paces. No drill sergeant&#39;s command ever
brought up an absent-minded beggar on
parade as did the words which fell on his ear.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
"I thought that was you, Mr. Masters!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice! The voice of his shattered
idol! The same voice: just as fresh and soft
and kind as ever! Her voice, speaking to him!
Could it be? Or was it a dream simply, a
chimera of his brain? Or was this voice&mdash;this
voice ringing, singing in his ears now&mdash;the
result of his highly fevered imagination
only?</p>

<p class="indent">He feared to turn his head to see. To
know whether it was in reality the woman
for whom he had been ready to lay down his
life&mdash;whom he had considered a princess
among women; chaste, pure, modest; whose
dethronation had been so recent. Whom he
had come to think of as soiled.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes! She was there before him in the
flesh! This perfidious parody of perfection,
this transmuted ideal. He waited for a
moment motionless; then raised his cap&mdash;a
merely mechanical act.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides, being a woman, whatever else she
might be, she was exempt from rudeness at
his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Her sex protected her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>MISUNDERSTANDINGS</h3>

<p class="indent">"Aren&#39;t you going to sit on Our Seat?
Or don&#39;t you need a rest?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was said archly; the significant reference
to Our Seat, subtly conveyed. She seemed
to have shaken off the depression of yesterday.
Was herself; her own blithe, bright
self again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mechanically Masters accepted the implied
invitation; sat. There ensued silence; a
silence which told more than speech. Not
the silence which breathes of sweet accord
between two understanding hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">She, on her part, was filled with wonder&mdash;expectancy&mdash;an
undefined sense of something
being wrong. He was not insensible
of the fact that the plumage of his dove was
rustling. No woman could, of course, endure
such treatment.</p>

<p class="indent">The need for speech on his part was plain:
but, somehow, he was at a loss for words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
Was yet alive to the fact that she would
read his speechlessness her own way: would
set him down as guilty of caddish behaviour.
The silence became tense: the strain was
fast becoming unbearable.</p>

<p class="indent">But little time passed; she got to her feet&mdash;being
the kind of woman quick to take
offence. The insult was felt the more acutely
because, she told herself, she was alone to
blame: had simply courted it, brought it on
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">She had wanted to meet this man. Had
hurried on to the parade with the feeling in
her heart that it would be good to meet him.
Had sat on the seat for a minute&#39;s rest and
a faint sense of grief that she had not encountered
him on her walk. Had been thinking
disconsolately of walking home, when she
was rendered joyful by his presence.</p>

<p class="indent">And then&mdash;to be treated like that!
Had she offended him? Such a possibility
passed rapidly through her mind; was as
rapidly rejected as a theory untenable. Did
he disapprove of her coming there alone,
at that time?</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that some men were punctilious
in regard to such matters. But he&mdash;natural,
unconventional as he was himself&mdash;surely it
could not be that. His voice interrupted
her reflections. In a husky, strained tone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
looking neither right nor left, but aimlessly
in front of him, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Nice, fine evening, isn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Another credit note to our fickle climate!
But the utter incongruity of the remark, the
exceedingly strange tone of his voice, caused
her to wheel round and look at him. Then
she saw. The moon chanced to be free
from clouds just then; its pale beams accentuated
the lividity of Masters&#39; face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my God! you are ill! What has
happened&mdash;an accident? What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">As she was quick of thought so she was
quick of movement. In a moment was kneeling
beside him&mdash;all the annoyance and hastily-aroused
temper gone to the winds. Only her
helpful woman&#39;s instinct aching to be of
service to him: to the man she loved.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is nothing. Don&#39;t&mdash;please. Don&#39;t
worry yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">Impulsively her arms went up to his
shoulders in sheer sympathy and kindliness.
All the stiffness, all the resentment, left her.
She was only just plainly and simply a
woman.</p>

<p class="indent">That being the case, her womanly pride
was relegated to a back seat. Her precious
dignity went down in value; right down to
nil. It was not in the question at all&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
question she asked as she gave herself to the
needs of the moment; asked with real
anxiety:</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me&mdash;what to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">The light was there on her face, in her
eyes! Oh, unmistakably there! The light
which yesterday he had prayed he might
see; that he had yearned for with his heart
and soul. Her soft beautiful radiant eyes
were looking with eager, tearful anxiety into
his own.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment&mdash;the influence of the moment
and forgetfulness in combination&mdash;he
felt that he must grasp, grip, strain her to
him. Hold her in one long, lasting embrace.
Then&mdash;he remembered! That an hour back
she had been clinging to, looking into another
man&#39;s face with the same tearful eyes! Oh,
the excellence, super-excellence, of her acting!
He would have given a king&#39;s ransom for the
ability to laugh just then&mdash;at himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Could it be&mdash;could it? For a brief instant
he doubted. The next moment blamed himself
for being a fool. But not a blind fool&mdash;oh,
no! He had the evidence of his
own eyes: the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of us, under such circumstances,
willingly take upon ourselves the threefold
responsibility of witness, jury and judge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
It is instinctive in most men: the desire to
ladle out justice. But the appeal court
sometimes oversets the decisions; Justice is
not infallible&mdash;perhaps her blindness has
something to do with it.</p>

<p class="indent">Few of us betray modesty when wearing
the ermine. The more rigorously we silence
the opposing counsel&mdash;the evidence of our
own hearts&mdash;the more we pride ourselves on
our impartiality, our exemplary Roman-fatherly
administration of justice. We are
apt to ignore any talk of a Court of Appeal;
arrogate to ourselves supreme wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Curiously enough, the more severe the
sentence we pronounce, the more we rise
in our own estimation. The rise may not be
permanent&mdash;seldom is; but while we are
at the high water mark of self-assurance
we generally make the most of the tide.
The sailing along on it is helped by the wind
of serene self-complacency; we sun ourselves
in vanity of our prowess. Forgetfulness is
there; that the tide&mdash;like the proverbial
lane or worm&mdash;has a knack of turning.</p>

<p class="indent">The dominant note in Masters at the
moment was anger. That such a woman
should have power over men. He mentally
thanked God that her power over him was
of the past. Laid the flattering unction to
his soul that perhaps he was cleaner-minded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
than his fellows. Man applies curious ointments
to his wounds!</p>

<p class="indent">But that thankfulness did not arrest his
anger; made it the greater perhaps. He
was hardly in a state of that judicial calm
which should characterize dispassionate inquiry.
Being angry, he spoke&mdash;after the
manner of the angry man&mdash;foolishly; said
brutally:</p>

<p class="indent">"This has been a busy evening with you.
Don&#39;t you get tired of hugging men? I am
the second in one hour."</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she made no movement, no
sound&mdash;save of the quick indrawing of her
breath. It was as if some icy blast had
suddenly assailed and frozen her to the spot.
Her face retained the same look; she was
too amazed&mdash;not understanding&mdash;too astonished
to do more than look. He went on
mercilessly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I saw the parting at your back door;
I was passing. Saw you slobbering over a
man there as you seem inclined to slobber
over me."</p>

<p class="indent">It was as if he had struck her! She drew
in her breath so that it sounded whistle-like.
Fell back; extending her arms, seemed as if
she would push him from her as something
unclean. In colourlessness her face rivalled
his.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
"How dare you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Those words were shaped on her white
lips. Then she stopped. The lips trembled,
tightened. Rising to her feet, the indignation
in her eyes as she looked down at him
completed the sentence.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed; that laugh with the underlying
sobbing catch in it, for his laughter
was not born of merriment. Said, righteous
indignation shining in his own eyes too:</p>

<p class="indent">"Dare! What do you mean? The witnessing
of it, or telling you of it?"</p>

<p class="indent">She scorned reply; he was really too
contemptible! Yet the woman in her bubbled
to the surface; she could not resist an
effort to hurt him:</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&mdash;you played the spy!"</p>

<p class="indent">A raising of his shoulders, a lowering of his
eyes, as he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Call it so if you wish."</p>

<p class="indent">He really did not care what she thought
of him; plainly showed that. The indifference
roused her; she tried again. Spoke
with forced quietness&mdash;standing a little way
from him&mdash;her voice full of contempt:</p>

<p class="indent">"There is a man bearing your name in the
High Street: a blacksmith. I could understand
such behaviour on his part. But&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her satisfaction came then: she had hurt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
A deep flush streamed over his face, then
faded altogether away, except for two red
streaks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Am I not behaving as one?"</p>

<p class="indent">Keenly sensitive to her rebuke, he spoke
half-apologetically. The bitterness of the
incident was making him more himself.
Brought home to him, forcefully, the irony
of things.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray pardon me." He rose and stepped
towards her. "Will you allow me to see you
home?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t touch me!"</p>

<p class="indent">There seemed an absolute fire burning in
her eyes, so intense was her scorn. She could
not have shrunk from him, or found him
more repellent, had he been a leper. Her
eyes seemed to scorch him.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew himself to be in the right; knew
it perfectly well; beyond the shadow of
a doubt. But standing before that searing
indignation, it was he who appeared to be
in the wrong, even to himself&mdash;his inmost
self.</p>

<p class="indent">Such treatment hurt. Thought of the
gross unfairness of it too was positively stinging.
He who was suffering&mdash;the victim&mdash;to
be put in the wrong! To be arraigned by the
victimiser!</p>

<p class="indent">His blood, his forehead, seemed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
burning hot, the while he was conscious
of cold shivers running through him. Was
this&mdash;he despised himself as he questioned&mdash;carrying
out his intention? Was he plucking
up his love by the roots?</p>

<p class="indent">It was weakness&mdash;he labelled it so&mdash;weakness
on his part that her words, her presence,
had still such power to move him. He
would be strong&mdash;strong and just. But he
realized the hardness of the task he set
himself. It was man&#39;s work; he would
prove himself worthy of it.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not deign him another word;
the wound to her pride was too severe for
that. Her blue eyes blazed, as perhaps only
blue eyes can. She would have given worlds
for tears to soften their burning heat, but
no tears came. Without another glance at
him she turned and walked away&mdash;assumed
an every-day gait; he should not think she
was excited.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not attempt to stop her. Why
should he? It was better so. Better that
the sharp severing blow had been struck
then than later: clean cuts heal quickest.
He would let her get well on her way home
before he moved. She must not think he
was trying to follow.</p>

<p class="indent">Standing on the edge of the wall he looked
out to sea. The water wore an appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
of invitation: that dangerous aspect which
has proved irresistibly attractive to so many.
Right out too, it looked so&mdash;so&mdash;so away
from everything.</p>

<p class="indent">The tide was receding; was going out and
away&mdash;to the Great Beyond. He knew that
if he chose he could go with it. It would
be so easy an act, if he stepped off the rocks
further down&mdash;into the water that was always
deep.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he pulled himself up with a jerk.
Pride came to the rescue. Was he to cave
in, go under, just because of a woman?
What a fool he was! What an unmitigated,
arrant fool! Was there a woman in the
world&mdash;the whole world&mdash;worth caring so
much for? No. Not one!</p>

<p class="indent">But his heart contradicted. He remembered
that anxious look on her face, the
loving attitude, the feel of her arms as they
rested on his breast, his shoulders. His, too,
was the remembrance of the warmth of the
sweet human breath; her eyes that had
looked into his. Then he looked out to sea
again; mentally out to the Great Beyond.
Asked himself the old, old question: Was
life worth living?</p>

<p class="indent">Bathos saved the situation. He remembered
that a character in one of his stories
had asked the same question: Was life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
worth living? The comic doctor had replied
that it depended&mdash;depended on the
liver!</p>

<p class="indent">He walked home.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>FEVERISH SYMPTOMS</h3>

<p class="indent">Masters did not leave Wivernsea. The
obstinacy of his character came into
play there; he had come down for a month,
and he stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">He had come for a purpose too&mdash;business
purpose&mdash;had his book to finish. Was a
trifling incident, the accident common to
men&#39;s lives, to disturb the current of his life?
To turn him from his prearranged plan in the
smallest degree? Perish the thought!</p>

<p class="indent">All he altered was the direction of his
walks; he thought that wisdom. Because,
like other wise men, he left the east and went
west. It was Cliffland there; sheltered spots
innumerable were easily found.</p>

<p class="indent">She, yet more proud than he, altered
nothing; took her walks with Gracie as
usual. Sat on the seat at the far end of the
walk; read novels there with stoic fortitude&mdash;except
for an occasional long look across
the waters.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Looking across the wide sea seems to
afford scope for, to encourage, limitless,
aimless reflections. At any rate hers were
aimless; she knew that. But a woman
dearly loves the memories of the past, to
bring them before her: to pet and fondle
and keep them alive with the warmth of her
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Being at opposite poles, east and west,
their daily meetings ended. Once he met
her in the post office; he was leaving as she
was entering. He raised his hat, and would&mdash;from
mere courtesy&mdash;have said: Good
Morning. But the unframed words wilted
on his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes, as they fell on him, lighted up
with indignation; a second edition of what
he had seen before. As they for a moment
rested on him they seemed to scorch up what
he would have said. His raised-to-hat hand
trembled and fell: he passed out.</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching home she found that she had
carried with her a recollection of his face.
By the seat he had said things to her that no
woman could forgive. She told herself that
an average hundred times a day&mdash;to say
nothing of the sleepless nights she passed
with thoughts full of him. But she was
sorry to see the haggard, worn look he was
wearing as he left the post office.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
He had appeared ill. His, she had told
him, was a face which had borne no worry
lines; lines of thought but not of trouble.
The absence of the latter had made him
appear younger than he really was.</p>

<p class="indent">With a smile she thought back on the time&mdash;it
seemed quite a long while ago&mdash;when
she had fancied that she had almost come to
love that eager, enthusiastic face; boyish,
but still with an air of manly determination
about it, set in a manly frame.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters&#39; shoulders were quite abnormally
broad and square; accentuated the impression
of strength made by the broad bronzed
forehead. How foolish women were, she
thought. Well, she had learnt a lesson;
she would profit by it. Experience had
taught her; she would prove herself a grateful
pupil.</p>

<p class="indent">She had deceived herself for the first time
and the last. Of course it was painful&mdash;the
awakening. Waking up to the perception
of unvarnished facts generally is unpleasant.
But she could look at her own foolishness
without wincing, indulgently&mdash;her foolishness
of a week ago. Just an error of judgment
that there was no scrap of likelihood of her
repeating.</p>

<p class="indent">Still&mdash;she admitted it to herself&mdash;he was
undeniably attractive. Hardly less so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
because he looked older in the post office
than he had done formerly. The worry lines,
whose absence she had remarked, were there
now.</p>

<p class="indent">One hasty glance had shown them to
her; they were so apparent. She wondered&mdash;a
kindly feeling stealing over her&mdash;whether
she had anything to do with it: the change.
Then memory came and withered up the
softness; pointed out what had been said to
her that night when she knelt by the seat!
The memory was a blasting breath; her
softness fell away.</p>

<p class="indent">The mere remembrance of it made her feel
hot all over. She&mdash;she to kneel to a man!
Because she had fancied he was ill&mdash;full
of kind feelings towards him, she had knelt;
and he had talked of hugging and slobbering!
To have her kindness, so well meant, recoil
on her, thrown back on her hands as it were,
with gratuitous, unwarranted insult instead
of thanks!</p>

<p class="indent">It is galling to have a gift returned; the
gall is greater when the gift is of the heart&#39;s
kindness; more galling still when the ungracious
recipient vacates a place in that
heart itself. The return then savours of
brutality.</p>

<p class="indent">Fury, too, came to her at the mere memory
of his speech. She was almost as angry as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
when the words rang freshly in her ears. But
with all the temper there was mingled wonder.
Surely he could not be a man to whom
brutality came easily. Why&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;had
he behaved so?</p>

<p class="indent">Fool? No. She told herself that she was
not that. She had read in his eyes that he
loved her; indeed, had more than once
checked his telling her so. What could be the
cause?</p>

<p class="indent">He had spoken of seeing her in the back
garden that night&mdash;but that was a mere
incident&mdash;there were a thousand-and-one
explanations of that. He would know that;
there must have been something else.</p>

<p class="indent">But why should she worry herself about
the matter&mdash;about the man? Plainly he was
not worthy a second thought. Ready to
misjudge her as he had been&mdash;well let him!
She did not care; not a scrap. She was
quite capable of fighting her way alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she picked up one of the books of his
he had given her. On the fly leaf she read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><i>Miss Mivvins; to remind her of Our Seat,
on which so many of these pages were
written.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>William Masters.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She stood with her eyes on the writing,
the book in her hand, for many minutes.
Then put the volume down with a sigh. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
all, she thought, real friends are as rare as
Christian charity.</p>

<p class="indent">Crunching sounds&mdash;boot pressure of gravel,
made her look out of the window on to the
path leading to the gate. The doctor was
coming up it to the house. She went out to
meet him.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie was not well&mdash;restless and feverish&mdash;was
now lying on her bed sleeping. The
doctor, on his previous visit, had thought it a
cold merely, but there were faint symptoms
which made him promise to come again.
He was there in fulfilment of that promise
now.</p>

<p class="indent">She was waiting for him at the door when
he reached it. Nodding to her, in an informal,
friendly way, he questioned cheerily:</p>

<p class="indent">"And how is the little one this morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Much better, I think, doctor. She is
sleeping peacefully now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sleeping? Still? Is she drowsy?...
Let me see her."</p>

<p class="indent">They walked into the bedroom together.
The noise of their entrance roused the child.
She looked up and around her, with the
frightened eyes of one suddenly awakened
from alarming dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, little girlie!"</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor spoke merrily. He was of that
type; did not carry the undertaker with him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
when visiting a patient. He advanced to
take the child&#39;s hand lying on the coverlet;
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"This is a nice idea of yours, upon my
word! Going to sleep in the day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">His intent in the adoption of a reassuring
tone was to change the current of her
thoughts: the wild thoughts evidently surging
in that active little brain. But when he
clasped the child&#39;s hand in his own, the merriment
left his voice, the smile his face. His
other hand he placed on her forehead, then
turning, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you not send for me?"</p>

<p class="indent">The mother was standing close beside the
child, stooping so that her face was on a level
with the terror-stricken little one&#39;s bright
eyes. She was speaking loving words, in the
loving way that appeals to children. Words
which read so foolishly, yet sound so sweetly.
She turned round suddenly, startled by the
gravity in the doctor&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Send!" she cried. "Why? She&mdash;she
is not&mdash;oh, don&#39;t tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush!"</p>

<p class="indent">She became quiet at once. Another phase
of the doctor&#39;s character showed: his will
power. The loving anxiety was suppressed.
The practical woman was to the fore, intent
on the doctor&#39;s instructions:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
"She must be undressed and put to bed.
Have a fire here; it must be kept going
night and day. Send one of your maids"&mdash;he
was writing on a leaf of his note-book as he
spoke, and finishing, tore it out&mdash;"with this
prescription at once."</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie was fever-stricken! Tossed in delirium
all that night and the next day. All the
next day and night&mdash;and the mother sat
by the bedside, tending, never leaving the
little one.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor came three and four times a
day. Each time he looked grave. There
was no sign of improvement in the child&#39;s
condition. The mother, worn out with watching,
ever looking to him for comfort, read
none.</p>

<p class="indent">Did ever&mdash;during all those hours of wearing,
waiting, anxious watching&mdash;the thought
of Masters cross her mind? She had shut
him resolutely out of her heart, turned the
key of consciousness upon him. But even
bolts and bars are proverbially of small
efficacy in such cases.</p>

<p class="indent">In those long hours, the only silence breaking
sounds were the monotonous ticking of
the clock and the short, quick breathing of
the little white-robed, white-faced form on
the white pillows. Sometimes, then, the
woman&#39;s resolution broke down; thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
of The Man crept in upon her all unbidden.
Gentler thoughts than she had harboured in
the previous days: troubles&#39; softening influence
was around.</p>

<p class="indent">Their first meeting! She thought of that.
Of his affection for Gracie; of the child&#39;s
love for him. Surely a child&#39;s instinctive
love and trust went for something. Perhaps,
after all&mdash;and then those horrible words of
his rang in her ears, and she hid her hot face
in the white coverlet. Never, never&mdash;they
were unforgivable. Besides, he did not seek
forgiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange that, by the bedside of the panting
child, with Life and Death fighting for
possession of the fragile little form, her ears
ever straining to catch the sound of that
softer breathing which she knew would signal
Life&#39;s victory&mdash;strange, that with fear and
hope surging in her bosom, even while her
gentle hand restrained her dear one&#39;s restless
tossing to and fro and cooled the burning
forehead and feverish, clinging little fingers;
strange that there should seem no wrong,
nothing incongruous in the thought of an
almost stranger&mdash;of William Masters. Perhaps
it was because Gracie loved him so
dearly: that must have been the reason.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor little Gracie! She little knew what
manner of man it was to whom she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
offered her affectionate, trusting little heart.
Yet he had been kind to her, more than kind.
There was pleasantness in the memory of
that.</p>

<p class="indent">Fugitive thoughts were these; stealing
in under cover of the night. Those hours
when that watchful keeper of the heart&mdash;a
woman&#39;s pride&mdash;is prone to forsake his trust;
to leave the secret of that heart revealed
before its Maker, and herself. A moment,
and the watchful sentinel is back again at his
post; repentant for his lapse, guarding his
treasure more jealously than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">The white soul of the child stood at the
entrance of the Valley of the Shadow. Hour
by hour the watching woman seemed to see
the Shadow deepening, growing. Hour by
hour she strove with all the power that in her
lay to lead that white soul back into life&#39;s
sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">The watching and anxiety told on her. The
doctor, noting her sunken eyes, had to speak
firmly:</p>

<p class="indent">"You must take rest. You need it as
much as your patient."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rest!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be foolish! You have a good
woman; this woman who is helping you."</p>

<p class="indent">"She has been a nurse."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see she understands. You must take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
rest or you will be ill. Ill, too, at a time when
you are most needed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me, doctor. Oh! For God&#39;s sake,
tell me&mdash;you don&#39;t know what she is to me!
Tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear madam, I can tell you nothing.
As it nears midnight, will come a crucial
time. Humour her; whatever she wants,
no matter how extravagant it may seem, let
her have it. She has an excitable nature,
a nervous temperament. Do all you can to
soothe her. She must not worry for anything:
it might prove her death. Gratify
her desires and she may sleep&mdash;sleep will be
her salvation. You understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, doctor."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whatever she asks for, gratify her."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, doctor."</p>

<p class="indent">"She is needing sleep; rest for that active
little brain of hers. She is full of ideas of
triple-headed giants, fairies and stories of
that sort. Don&#39;t contradict her, get her into
a state of contentment if possible. Who is
this Prince Charlie she was asking for just
now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A friend&mdash;a casual friend&mdash;some one we
know."</p>

<p class="indent">"She is inexplainably anxious to see him.
Soothe, by letting her do so if possible. She
has intervals when she is as rational as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
or I; it is well to prolong those by letting
her talk to people she knows and wants to see.
Does he live far away&mdash;this Prince Charlie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In&mdash;in the town."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, by all means, if she asks again,
send for him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, doctor."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fretting and excitement are to be
avoided. Soothe her in every possible way;
gentleness and firmness combined go a long
way. But this Prince Charlie&mdash;from the hold
he seems to have on her&mdash;may go a longer way
still. Of course she may not ask for him
again&mdash;maybe it is a mere delirious fancy&mdash;but
if she does, you will know how to act."</p>

<p class="indent">But Gracie did ask again. Asked persistently,
petulantly, pleadingly. The watcher
with the breaking heart allowed the mother
in her nature to smother the mere woman.
She resolved to humble herself in the dirt:
to send for him; he who had so grossly
insulted her.</p>

<p class="indent">She would not write, she would not see him
herself: she could not. She would send a
verbal message. Late as it was there was
no fear of not finding him up, she knew. He
had told her that he always wrote till one in
the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The midnight oil phrase was one he was
ever using.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>TO BEG FOR MERCY</h3>

<p class="indent">An upward glance at the clock on the
mantel. It was late: within an hour
of midnight. The servants had already gone
to bed. Going to their rooms she gently
knocked at the door; called to one of them
by name:</p>

<p class="indent">"Ellen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, ma&#39;am."</p>

<p class="indent">The reply in a frightened, startled voice.
The tone betrayed the maid&#39;s fear that she
was to hear bad news. The next words were
a relief:</p>

<p class="indent">"You know where Mr. Masters lives?"</p>

<p class="indent">The possibility of a want of knowledge on
the part of the servants never occurred to her.
She was not in the least surprised when an
affirmative answer was returned to her:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, ma&#39;am."</p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to get up at once, Ellen&mdash;I
am sure you will not mind&mdash;and dress yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
quickly. Go to Mr. Masters, give him my
compliments, and ask him&mdash;ask him to come
here&mdash;to be kind enough to come here at
once."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, ma&#39;am. Certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had listened in astonishment, but
obediently set about the task set her. She
was fond of children, was Ellen; was thankful
too that she had not, as she had feared at
first, been called to hear bad news about
Miss Gracie.</p>

<p class="indent">The maid had no thought of grumbling at
the late service demanded of her, although
greatly wondering at the message she was
to deliver. The over-wrought, tired woman
returned to the sick room and waited.
Presently the little lips&mdash;for the hundredth
time&mdash;shaped the question:</p>

<p class="indent">"I want Prince Charlie; won&#39;t he come
and tell me about the fairy and Jack?"</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s heart was full of thankfulness
that she had sent; that she had humbled herself
to do so. She was able to bend over and
whisper:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, darling. Mother has sent for him.
He will be here directly."</p>

<p class="indent">She was without fear in making the
promise; felt so sure he would come. He
was a gentleman, he would understand.
He would know how urgent must be the need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
which could demand his presence at that late
hour&mdash;indeed, to send for him at all. Or
would he think&mdash;No! The thought was too
horrible! She stifled it.</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting, waiting, waiting&mdash;weary waiting!
At last she heard the maid&#39;s returning steps
on the path without; ran to the door and
opened it. The girl spoke reluctantly; what
she had to say made the mother turn sick
at heart.</p>

<p class="indent">"Said, ma&#39;am, it was too late to come out
to-night. He would come round in the
morning."</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s mind failed to grasp it: that
message. The callous cruelty of it. It
seemed too&mdash;too impossible. Had he misunderstood&mdash;misjudged
her? Could it be?
Had she fallen so low in his estimation?
A crimson flood overspread her face.... After
a pause, as if clutching at a straw, she inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you see him yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, ma&#39;am. He seemed to wonder
what you could want with him. Said it
would keep, whatever it was, till the morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep&mdash;till&mdash;the&mdash;morning!"</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie&#39;s pleading, her own promise, rang
in her ears! Keep till the morning.
The irony of it! She staggered against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
wall, passed her hand across her brow&mdash;loath
to believe that the author, fond of children,
could behave so&mdash;asked again&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"You are quite sure you saw him yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, ma&#39;am. I know Mr. Masters
quite well by sight." She did&mdash;Masters,
the blacksmith! She had been to his shop in
the High Street, and in response to her ringing
of his house bell, he had put his head
out of his bedroom window and spoken to
her. Not in any very pleasant tone; he was
not pleased that his beauty sleep had been
broken into.</p>

<p class="indent">He was an early-to-bed and early-to-rise
old man. He could see no sense in turning
out at past eleven o&#39;clock at night for any one.
Not even for a sick child or for the finest lady
in the land.</p>

<p class="indent">As he went grumbling back to his bed the
blacksmith muttered that some of them fine
ladies seemed to think it was a nonner to be
at their beck and call; summat to be proud
of, it was, for a poor man like hisself. None of
their airs for him&mdash;he wasn&#39;t having any, this
time. Such was his grumble; weighted with a
plethora of adjectives&mdash;of a quite unprintable
kind.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother staggered back into the bedroom,
to the child&#39;s side. White-faced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
trembling in every limb, supported herself
by the bed rail. Noted the hour: past eleven
o&#39;clock. The crucial time the doctor had
spoken of was approaching.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie was in a quite rational mood. Her
brightly burning eyes were fixed on her mother
as she entered the room, and she spoke at
once, eagerly&mdash;as eagerly as the feeble little
lips could frame words&mdash;stuttering in her
eagerness:</p>

<p class="indent">"Has Pr&mdash;Prince Charlie come yet,
mamma?"</p>

<p class="indent">Right down into the depths of despair sank
the mother&#39;s heart. She took the child&#39;s
hot hand in her own; gently brushed the curls
away from the little forehead with the other.
As she did so the hot dryness of that brow
was brought to her notice afresh. It was
necessary to answer the child; the reply was
gently given. Yet the utterance of each word
was as a stab to her:</p>

<p class="indent">"Not&mdash;not yet, darling."</p>

<p class="indent">A little whimpering, plaintive voice uprose
from amongst the pillows:</p>

<p class="indent">"I want him, mamma&mdash;won&#39;t he come?"</p>

<p class="indent">How was she to gratify the little one&#39;s
desire: to get Prince Charlie there? The
doctor had warned her that at this stage the
child&#39;s demands were to be granted if possible.
If possible. She had sent and he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
refused to come. The doctor&#39;s words rang
in her ears. If Possible.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought of the man sitting&mdash;as she
knew he would be&mdash;shaping with his pen,
fictional pathetic pictures, intended to draw
tears from the tender-hearted. She thought
of the real pathos of this child, perhaps
dying, to whom he might bring life and hope
by his mere immediate presence. And he had
returned the message: That It Would Keep.</p>

<p class="indent">The child tossed uneasily from side to side.
The corners of the arched little mouth went
down threateningly. If Possible! Was it
possible to bring him&mdash;by any means? Was
it possible for her to sink her womanhood
even deeper? To humble herself to Beg of
him to come? Would he come even if she
did?</p>

<p class="indent">Then the direction came from the little
form tossing restlessly from side to side; the
weak voice whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">"You said he would come, mamma. Won&#39;t
you fetch him? He will come if you fetch
him."</p>

<p class="indent">Would he? Was that the possibility?
Was the little one wise in saying that? She
remembered that out of the mouths of babes
and&mdash;&mdash;Well, she could but try. The mother
in her was mighty, stronger than all else:
prevailed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
There was no mental balance used in her
decision. No conscious weighing of pros
and cons. The duty&mdash;if aught prompted
by love is duty&mdash;stood clear before her.
Something greater than her own will impelled
her decision. She would at once go to him
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Glancing at the clock again, she saw that
the recorded time was half-past eleven. She
would go to him. Go on her knees to him:
would not spare herself further. Would
beg him, for God&#39;s sake, to be more merciful
than he had shown himself in his message.
Entreat him not to put off till to-morrow&mdash;when
it might be too late&mdash;that which
could be done to-night.</p>

<p class="indent">Self-blame just then she was very full of;
bitterness for not having gone to him in the
first instance herself. Tortured herself with
the thought that it might now be too late.
Wondered if God would forgive her obstinate
pride. Still be merciful to her: still let her
keep her child.</p>

<p class="indent">She bent over the bed and spoke close into
the little ear. Made spasmodic but unavailing
attempts to control her emotion: could not
bring herself to utter the words more than
just audibly:</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll be quite still, darling, won&#39;t you,
whilst mother goes to fetch him?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
The face turned upwards. The mother
kissed it passionately, tenderly, again and
again. The wasted little arms went round
her neck and clung there gratefully. Mother
was going to fetch Prince Charlie!</p>

<p class="indent">From the adjoining room the woman who
assisted in the child&#39;s nursing came; posted
herself by the bedside. Then the mother&mdash;staggering
as if the unknown gaped before
her&mdash;left the room. In the hall slipped on
the cloak which, she remembered, he had
buttoned.</p>

<p class="indent">She spent no time in seeking a hat. Swung
the hood up from behind over her head. So
hurried out of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">So, into the night.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>ON HER KNEES TO HIM</h3>

<p class="indent">Wivernsea was asleep. Like its
blacksmith, it believed in the theory
of early rising. Not a light was to be seen
in one of the windows she passed. Not until
she came to the end of the Marine Terrace.
There she saw an illuminated window: her
beacon.</p>

<p class="indent">It was but a short distance from her own
place; not ten minutes&#39; walk. She seems to
have spent as many hours in covering it.
Despite the proverb, time does not always
fly.</p>

<p class="indent">The house which Masters lodged in was
known to her. He had described the quaintness
of its old-fashioned bay window; the
only one in the row. She would have known
it as his place without even the beacon light
for identification. He was a slave of the
lamp: consumed the midnight oil.</p>

<p class="indent">As she made towards the light she prayed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
almost aloud. Prayed for a conquering power&mdash;over
her pride. That she might be humble.
For the framing of words to move this man
when she besought him to come. Soulfully
prayed that God would incline his heart to
hear her prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">Three steps&mdash;she faltered up them; proximity
to her goal rendered her invertebrate&mdash;brought
her to the level of the door. If she
put her hand over the rails she could tap at
the window. It would be better so than
disturbing the household by knocking. She
tapped.</p>

<p class="indent">Her actions elicited no response! She
waited, with a hard-beating heart. Still
no reply: dead silence! Had he expected
this&mdash;this visit of hers&mdash;and resolved to
remain obdurate?</p>

<p class="indent">The window blind was not pulled down
to its full length. Through the lace edging
she could see the man calmly writing;
writing as if thoroughly engrossed in his
work. Evidently the thought of his cruelty
did not trouble him in the least.</p>

<p class="indent">In desperation, there seemed nothing else
to do, she used her fingers again: loudly.
Masters looked up; started in astonishment.
Heard a distinct tapping on the glass of his
window!</p>

<p class="indent">He walked to the casement; pulled the cord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
attached to a spring roller, and in a moment
the blind had shot up. Outside all was moonlight
brightness. At first he looked straight
away; saw only the sea with the intervening
roadway. Then, suddenly, at the side, on the
steps, saw a woman with a ghastly white,
haggard face looking at him! The Woman
He Loved!</p>

<p class="indent">Start? He almost jumped in his amazement!
Was he dreaming? Was it his
phantasy? Then he came plump to earth;
lost no further time in surmises; went to the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">The room opened on to the hall; the
street door was but a couple of yards away.
He had gripped its handle and opened it in
a moment. The woman was there&mdash;no
phantasy&mdash;flesh and blood, clinging to the
railings.</p>

<p class="indent">"My God! What has happened to bring
you at this hour?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Just&mdash;a&mdash;moment!"</p>

<p class="indent">The answer given weakly; breathlessly. A
swerve, and she would have fallen, but for an
almost nerveless clutch at the railings&mdash;but
that he was by her side in a moment, with a
strong upholding arm round her waist.</p>

<p class="indent">There was unconsciousness of his clasp;
things were all going round with her.... She
had a feeling of being lifted; then set down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
again. Then&mdash;then a blankness: consciousness
left her.</p>

<p class="indent">For a brief moment Masters held her in
his arms; her whole weight. For a brief
moment the blood coursed wildly through
his veins; surged brainwards. A wild, mad
impulse seized him: to press his lips to hers,
helpless, passive as she lay there.</p>

<p class="indent">With difficulty he restrained himself. Laid
down his burden reverently; her angel&#39;s face
seemed eloquent of innocence. Once, surely
once on a time, it had spoken truth. Ah!
What Might Have Been.</p>

<p class="indent">She opened her eyes. Found herself lying
on a sofa. Masters standing by her side,
holding brandy. She tried, feebly, to push
it away; but his now full-of-authority voice
commanded:</p>

<p class="indent">"Drink!"</p>

<p class="indent">She was constrained to do so by reason of
a hand which went under and lifted her
head; another which placed the glass to her
lips.... Struggling to a sitting position,
passing her hand across her eyes, with a
pitiful little drooping at the corners of her
mouth, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg your pardon for&mdash;for&mdash;Was I
silly? Did I&mdash;I felt a little faint."</p>

<p class="indent">He remained watching her. His own face
had grown almost the colour of hers. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
had touched her, had had her hand in his,
had felt the softness of her hair! It seemed
to him as if the noise of the beating of his
heart drowned the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me," he inquired, still supporting
her, "what brings you here so late?"</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head. Womanlike, answered
his question by another:</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn&#39;t the girl tell you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What girl?" He asked in surprise.
"Didn&#39;t the girl tell me what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About Gracie. I&mdash;I sent to you half-an-hour
ago. She&mdash;they tell me&mdash;I think&mdash;Oh,
my God!&mdash;I am so&mdash;so afraid!&mdash;is dying.
She asked for you again and again. You
sent a message that you would come tomorrow."</p>

<p class="indent">"I!"</p>

<p class="indent">His astonished look, the blaze of suddenly
aroused anger in his eyes, frightened her.
Could he be even now deceiving her? His
kindness&mdash;was it falsity? She hurried on
with her explanation; in her embarrassment
the words tumbled from her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. You did&mdash;did you not? Ah!
Don&#39;t tell me there was any mistake&mdash;the girl
saw you herself! I ought to be with Gracie
now, but you wouldn&#39;t come when I sent for
you. She&mdash;I&mdash;thought if I came for you,
you wouldn&#39;t be so hard. You could not&mdash;oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
you could not&mdash;if you knew that perhaps
her very life depended on you."</p>

<p class="indent">In speaking she had fallen on her knees;
knelt to him in her entreaty. It hurt; he
could not bear to see her&mdash;a woman&mdash;in this
attitude of supplication to him. Almost
roughly he raised her to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">When erect, not seeing through her
tear-streaming eyes, choked with her emotion,
she plucked at his coat sleeve. The action
horrified him; recalled the night he had
stood beside his mother&#39;s death-bed; the
dying woman had plucked at the counterpane
in just such a way. Roughly&mdash;to hide his
aroused emotion&mdash;he shook himself free.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she seized on and took his hand in
her own burning hot shaking ones. Continued
to plead, sobs breaking her utterance:</p>

<p class="indent">"It is a child; a little child dying! She
wanted to see you so much! The doctor said
we were to gratify her, soothe her, and perhaps
get her to a sleep which will save her life. You
will come back with me&mdash;oh, you will, will
you not? She knows I have come to fetch
you. She was so confident you would come!
I&mdash;I have annoyed you, or done something
to displease you, I know that, but I am all
humility now, Mr. Masters; humble, oh, so
humble!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
She had slid to her knees again before he
could stop her; continued;</p>

<p class="indent">"Humbly begging your pardon for whatever
I have done. Praying you, for my
little child&#39;s sake, to come back with me,
please.... Please.... Please!"</p>

<p class="indent">For a second time he stooped and raised
the sobbing woman; bodily picked her up. He
was naturally a strong man, and the feeling
filling him just then lent additional strength.</p>

<p class="indent">He was so much moved by the present
that he lost sight of all he had heard, all he
had seen in the past. Only knew that this
woman, whom he loved with all his heart
and soul, whose shoes he would have kissed,
knelt to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"How dare you?"</p>

<p class="indent">His question was put fiercely, as in that
moment of lifting, he held her tightly to
him. He repeated it:</p>

<p class="indent">"How dare you kneel to me? How dare
you beg of me to do what the most inhuman
wretch in the world would do?"</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment he left her side; inside that
time had slipped into his overcoat and drawn
a cap from his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">"Finish that brandy."</p>

<p class="indent">There was that in his voice which commanded
obedience; she never thought of disobeying.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
"You will come?"</p>

<p class="indent">She put the question tremblingly; holding
the glass to her lips as she did so with a
shaking hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"At once."</p>

<p class="indent">A feeling of anger took possession of him:
that she could put such a question; he
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"How can you ask?"</p>

<p class="indent">Her only answer was a soulful, grateful
cry; a cry from her heart:</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank God!"</p>

<p class="indent">He was feeling himself considerably less of
a hero than on the last occasion of their
meeting. But this was not a time for thought;
as he opened the door he said, speaking almost
gruffly:</p>

<p class="indent">"You can see your way?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was quite light enough shed by the
moon for that; and there was light ahead
too! She knew she could rely on him; the
very sound of his voice told her that; was an
inspiration in itself. Making her way to
the hall door she staggered out; down the
little stone flight to the pavement.</p>

<p class="indent">Ere she reached the bottom step, he had
turned down the lamp, closed the house door
and joined her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take my arm.... Cling to me tightly.
You are not fit to walk alone."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
And she clung. Forgot all he had said to
her. Just had something strong and powerful
to cling to in her time of trouble, and she
clung. Her heart beat so as to pain her.
She heard him speak and spoke to him in
reply. But all the while her heart was full
of prayers of gratitude. God had been very
good to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Every step they took brought them nearer
the bungalow. Nearer the realization of
hopes upon which she had almost erected
a monument. She knew&mdash;felt rather&mdash;for
certain that he would save Gracie. Faith
was strong in her.</p>

<p class="indent">He kept her talking all the way they
walked. Thought to divert her mind from
thoughts of the sick chamber they were
coming to. But she wanted to think of it;
there was happiness in the thought. Her
companion&#39;s voice rang so cheerily&mdash;it gave
her hope. There seemed magic in it; power
to dispel doubts and fears.</p>

<p class="indent">"What did you mean by a girl and a
message you sent half-an-hour ago? My landlady
went to bed about nine o&#39;clock. There
has not been a soul near the house since."</p>

<p class="indent">"A mistake evidently."</p>

<p class="indent">She answered feebly. Was too fatigued
to seek explanation. He was there, going
home with her&mdash;that was enough.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
"In some way, yes. But there was no
mistake in your thinking me capable of such
brutality as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped. Recollected the words he had
himself used to her in his anger at their last
meeting. She was entitled to judge him so;
was fully justified. The reflection was bitter
as gall.</p>

<p class="indent">She had no suspicion why he paused. Had
she known, her answer might have been
different. As it was she said meekly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Please don&#39;t be angry with me."</p>

<p class="indent">It would have been impossible for her to
choose words more likely to touch him in
his present mood of self-reproach. She spoke
too with such an appeal in her tremulous
voice, that retention of his anger would have
meant changing his whole nature.</p>

<p class="indent">He strode on. It was all she could do to
keep up with him. His anxiety was to get
where he might be of help. He forgot; he
had had so little to do with women.</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the bungalow. Divested
themselves of their outdoor garments in the
hall. The house was so quiet, Death himself
might have been in possession. It struck
an unpleasant chill to the new comer.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he followed her to the sick room.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>GOD&#39;S LITTLE BOY</h3>

<p class="indent">Gracie was sitting up in bed, propped
up by the pillows. Masters gave a
sigh of relief: they were not too late. Death
might be knocking at the door, but had not
yet been admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">The child looked expectantly at the door
as her mother opened it. Her cheeks and
eyes were bright with the fever in them.
Then the expectant look mellowed into a
smile. She had seen the man behind!</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew you would come, Prince Charlie!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you did! Knew I should come
when I knew you wanted me. I shouldn&#39;t
have been much of a Prince Charlie if I
hadn&#39;t, should I?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters sat on the bed with his back
against the headrail. Put his arm round the
little one and snuggled her to him. She
nestled up to him with a croon&mdash;a little
grunting ejaculation of content&mdash;as he tucked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
the clothes closely round her. Did not seem
to desire to talk, was just simply happy in
having him there. He inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Comfy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Awful."</p>

<p class="indent">He was grieved to feel how she had fallen
away. How, in a few days, she had grown
so thin. For the mother&#39;s and child&#39;s sakes,
he made no outward manifestation of his
grief: expressed no surprise. He felt that
his mission just then was to brighten, not to
shed gloom. Spoke jestingly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Now that Prince Charlie is here, what
have you to say to his royal highness?
Nothing?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I dreamed a dream, Prince Charlie!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. That you were married to me;
that you were my husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you? Now that was something
like a dream! What sort of husband did
I make?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. You see the dream didn&#39;t
last long enough."</p>

<p class="indent">"That was a bad job! Because if you
had liked me in the dream, you might have
married me later on."</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought that." She spoke quite gravely.
"But you see I know I should like you as a
husband."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
"I am glad you think that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who asks? Do you say to me &#39;marry
me,&#39; or do I say to you &#39;marry me&#39;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"M&#39;well, that depends. I really don&#39;t
think it would matter much; which ever way
you like best."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, you would marry me if I asked
you? What do I have to do&mdash;kneel down,
like the Prince in Cinderella?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That is the really proper way, of course.
But if you have a very pretty pinafore on it
would be a pity, wouldn&#39;t it? Then I think
you could manage without kneeling."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see. I could put on my black dress,
though. It&#39;s got some sticky stuff I spilt
down the front."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I am afraid before this marriage
takes place you will have to grow a little
older."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course!"</p>

<p class="indent">She essayed a laugh. The mother pricked
up her ears: it was the first time the sound
of laughter had come from those lips for many
an hour; the child continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t think I am so silly as to think
I can be married in short frocks, do you?
What an old goose you are! Of course, I
mean when I am bigger and wear a train."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see. Do you think the black dress
will grow too?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
"N&mdash;no. I forgot that&mdash;that&#39;s my fault.
But you promised."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why certainly. I most cheerfully promise
that I will marry you, if you ask me when
you are a big girl."</p>

<p class="indent">"A real, real promise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A most really, real, realiest of real
promises. If you ask me when you are a
big girl, to marry you, I promise you I will."</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed contentedly. Nestling to him,
closed her eyelids as she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"People go away for honey-dews, don&#39;t
they?"</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled. Gathered that she had confused
names by reading the label on his tobacco
packet. She had seen him fill his pouch, and
clamoured for the silver paper to make impressions
of coins on. To her huge satisfaction
had more than once induced him to
pick up her coinage in the belief that they
were real.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he answered. "It is usual for
married persons to go away. We must
consider where we will spend our honeymoon.
You have been to the Hippodrome, haven&#39;t
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes opened; sparkled at the recollection.
The dustmen were banished for a
moment as she answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Twice! That&#39;s where I saw Cinderella!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
"That wouldn&#39;t be altogether a bad place
for a honeymoon, would it? Then there&#39;s
the Zoo&mdash;how about that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lovely! You are a very dear old Prince
Charlie. I think if I couldn&#39;t marry you I
wouldn&#39;t marry anybody. I am sorry for
all the other little girls that can&#39;t marry you.
You know lots of little girls, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. But then you are my real sweetheart,
you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m glad. &#39;Cos you can&#39;t marry more
than one, can you? I hope the other little
girls won&#39;t cry, all the same."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think they will. Some of them
are bigger than you; have given up crying."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, big little girls cry! But they don&#39;t
make a noise, and they don&#39;t like you to see.
I&#39;ve seen mamma cry!"</p>

<p class="indent">Prince Charlie was silent; he too had seen
the mother&#39;s tears. The child prattled on:</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall have to go all the way to Heaven
when we are married, shan&#39;t we?"</p>

<p class="indent">He wondered what childish idea could
prompt such a question; asked:</p>

<p class="indent">"What makes you think that, darling?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When we went to church last Sunday&mdash;no,
it was the Sunday before; the man in the
white dress said so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; he did really. I heard him quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
plainly. He said &#39;marriages are made in
heaven.&#39; Is heaven very, very beautiful,
Prince Charlie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Much more beautiful than we can even
think it is, darling."</p>

<p class="indent">"All the good little girls go there, don&#39;t
they?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Most certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">"When doctors come to people they are
ill, aren&#39;t they? And they die sometimes when
they are ill, don&#39;t they?... If I die now
shall I go right straight to heaven, Prince
Charlie?"</p>

<p class="indent">The woman kneeling by the bedside turned
away her head. The trembling hand found
her throat and helped to stifle the sob bursting
there. Life and death were fighting for
conquest. Contemplation of the battle is
ever sad; sadder because the watchers can
do nought to turn the tide of victory. Time
was arbiter; yet the little one was speaking as
if the Grim One&#39;s victory were assured.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little quaver, just a little
huskiness, in Masters&#39; voice, as he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t talk of dying, Gracie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I am not going to die yet."</p>

<p class="indent">The child&#39;s attempt at a laugh was pitiful,
by reason of the lack of mirth in it; she
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I shouldn&#39;t be able to marry you till you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
got to heaven if I did, should I? How full
it must be up there of little boys and girls,
Prince Charlie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, darling."</p>

<p class="indent">He acquiesced aloud; truthfully. Then
added, under his breath:</p>

<p class="indent">"Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p class="indent">"God is very fond of children, isn&#39;t
He?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very fond."</p>

<p class="indent">Again there came to him a suggestion; to
himself he quoted:</p>

<p class="indent">"Suffer little children to come unto Me."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are very fond of little children too,
aren&#39;t you?" She nestled, if possible, a
little closer. "Mamma says she knows you
are."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mamma is right, darling. Very fond."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you don&#39;t love any of them better
than you do me, do you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Her blue eyes were fixed on his face as she
looked up, eager to hear his reply; quite
truthfully he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Not one. Not one."</p>

<p class="indent">"I forgot." A little sigh of content.
"You told me that before. You haven&#39;t
any children of your real own, have you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m glad of that."</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed in the same way again. Pillowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
her head more deeply on his arm; inquired
suddenly:</p>

<p class="indent">"God has a Child of his real own, hasn&#39;t
He?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, love."</p>

<p class="indent">"A little boy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Was a little boy; yes, darling."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know. Because we keep His birthday;
same as we keep mine. Only mine comes
with the roses, His with the holly. You
know&mdash;it is on Christmas day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; we all of us keep it, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Prince Charlie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, darling?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know any stories about God&#39;s
Little Boy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dear; some."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me&mdash;a nice story about Him&mdash;will
you? No giants or bears in it, because I
feel so sleepy&mdash;and I am too tired.... So
tired.... I would like to go to sleep&mdash;just
like this&mdash;in your arms."</p>

<p class="indent">He bent his head. Kissed the flushed,
sweet little face he was cradling in the hollow
of his arm. Then told the story of the
birth of God&#39;s Little Boy; in a manner
adapted to the little ears listening to it.</p>

<p class="indent">Her sleepiness grew; the blue eyes opened
each time more reluctantly. As the little
body lost its stiffness, he blue-pencilled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
story down to the stage where God&#39;s Little
Boy was lying asleep in the manger. And
the watching angels&mdash;even as the narrator
was&mdash;were continually saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"Hus-s-h!"</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that he repeated this part of the
story again and again to bring in the soothing
"Hus-s-sh" passed unnoticed by Gracie.
Her eyes had closed; she was asleep. The
doctor had said sleep would be her salvation.</p>

<p class="indent">The crucial time&mdash;midnight&mdash;and she slept!</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE PASSING OF THE NIGHT</h3>

<p class="indent">The tone of the story-teller&#39;s voice had
grown softer and softer; had dropped
lower and lower; then stopped altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">The silence caused the woman, whose
pent-up emotion had been finding vent in
silent tears, to uplift her head. Her very
soul was gladdened by the picture upon
which her eyes rested.</p>

<p class="indent">The man had drawn the coverlet up so
that it shielded the wearied little eyes from
the light. Her child was asleep! Peacefully
sleeping in the arms of Prince Charlie.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been kneeling with her face buried
in her hands, on the same side of the bed as
he sat. Now she had but to bend to reach
his disengaged hand. The burning, feverish
lips were pressed to it, with all the heartfelt
fervour inspired by a mother&#39;s gratitude:
surely the very strongest inspiration in the
world.</p>

<p class="indent">Ere she took her lips away he felt, drop&mdash;drop&mdash;drop.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Three tears on his hand!
Tears from the eyes of the woman to whom,
in her grief, his heart opened. Despite the
fact that he had thought it closed against
her for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">His heart was very full just then. A
veritable agony of love was in his eyes as
he looked at her. Passionate words were
framed in his thoughts; rose to his lips and
were choked back.</p>

<p class="indent">Except for that strained expression in his
eyes, his face was calm as stone; the pallor
likened it to marble. But the woman&#39;s head
was bent; his suffering was unseen by her.</p>

<p class="indent">It pained him&mdash;her gratitude. He had
done so little to deserve it. Indeed would
have been a brute had he done less. No
thanks were due to him; acceptance of them
made him feel himself in a false position.
But he could do nothing to restrain her&mdash;for
fear of waking Gracie.</p>

<p class="indent">She moved a little away, glancing again
at the sleeping child with a deep sigh of
thankfulness. A slight movement of his
head, a look in his eyes, beckoned her to
come closer.</p>

<p class="indent">She understood. Noiselessly walked behind
him; stood so, leaning over the bed
rail. Her head was close to his, as he asked
in an undertone:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
"The medicine?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She should take it in two hours."</p>

<p class="indent">"She must."</p>

<p class="indent">He said that in a whisper, with a meaning
glance at the child&#39;s flushed face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will it be wise to awaken her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Distinctly; in case of fever. Besides, at
this stage, the more she sleeps the more
easily she will go to sleep again. Poor little
mite! This is not half so comfortable a
position for her as if she were lying down, but
I can&#39;t move her till the slumber feeling
gets a tighter hold on her. I shall awaken
her at medicine time, and she will go to sleep
quickly enough by then in any position.
Drink?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Milk. There is some."</p>

<p class="indent">She pointed to a jug standing on a table
near by. His eyes followed the direction of
her hand; he nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good. Now, lie you down on the sofa.
Try and get some sleep yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">She drew back in astonishment at his
suggestion. Shook her head; then expostulated:</p>

<p class="indent">"I could not!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You must!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I cou&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t want to annoy&mdash;to seriously
annoy me, do you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
The voice was very earnest; that voice
which she found so wonderfully deep and
thrilling. Even in its whisper there was,
for her, all the power of great music; even
in the lightest words he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">She brushed a tear from her eyes. Once
more impulsively bent and kissed the hand
which was resting on the rail. He whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me ask you to lie down&mdash;to oblige
me. Will you do that? You have not
slept for long. I, as you know, am a veritable
owl; a complete night-bird. My consumption
of midnight oil is a standing joke. It
is easier for me to keep awake than to go to
sleep&mdash;oblige me."</p>

<p class="indent">All the boy in him had departed for the
time. Yet there was no effort, no conscious
assumption of manly dignity. On the contrary,
it suited him well. Seemed merely
another phase of his character.</p>

<p class="indent">Her answer was in as earnest a tone as he
himself used; strangely earnest considering
the smallness of his request; she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I would do anything&mdash;anything in the
world you asked me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then lie down. Remember that the
greatest pleasure you can give me will be to
see you asleep. That is not very complimentary
to you, is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">That was said in an endeavour to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
her smile. He was sorry he had spoken so
when he saw how the lips curved. Sad
smiles are not pretty things; he continued
hastily:</p>

<p class="indent">"And you may sleep in peace. Your
fears may be at rest; Gracie is doing well.
Short as has been her sleep, so far, I feel the
temperature is lower&mdash;her breathing to be
more regular. Now go."</p>

<p class="indent">Dutifully, obediently, she went. There
are some men who must be obeyed without
question. Masters was of those&mdash;when
he chose. That was not often. He was of
so kindly a nature that he never cared to
press his authority: unless occasion rendered
that course absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">The sofa was on the other side of the room.
He furtively watched her for a long time, as
she lay there with her eyes wide open.
Watched her unavailing fight against sleep;
smiled when at last she succumbed, when
Nature conquered. She went to sleep: a
sound sleep bred of that previous wakefulness
and anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">Time passed. The hands of the clock on
the mantel crept round slowly minute by
minute, twice. Then, very quietly, very
gently, he woke the child. She was so
sleepy and drowsy that his heart smote him;
it seemed almost cruel to rouse her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
The eyes opened widely for a minute in
surprise at seeing him there. Then she
remembered; the lids half closed again.
She stretched her hand a little higher up
his shoulder and said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re still here, Prince Charlie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, darling. I am going to stop all
night. We must not speak loudly; Mamma
is asleep; and she is so tired."</p>

<p class="indent">"So am I, Prince Charlie. Peepy and
thirsty. Will you give me some milk?"</p>

<p class="indent">"After this medicine, dear.... There.
Now the milk.... My! What a thirsty
little girlie. What? More!... We shall
have to buy another cow!"</p>

<p class="indent">He smoothed her pillow, laid her comfortably
down and stroked her brow. Was
glad to note how fast the feverishness was
leaving her; she was distinctly cooler. In
less than a minute she was peacefully asleep
again.</p>

<p class="indent">A good nurse, was Masters. Many trained
to the calling might have taken hints from
him. Some men are born that way.</p>

<p class="indent">He had in his composition just the right
proportions of firmness, kindness, and that
constant thoughtfulness for others which go
to make up the ideal attendant.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, he had a way, through some
subtle influence of his personality, of making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
his will felt without irritating by its actual
expression. He rarely raised opposition;
rather it fell away before him.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie was not the only being who succumbed
to this man&#39;s latent force of character.
Most people with whom he came in contact
felt its power, wholly unaware of it as he
was himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another satisfied glance at the sleeping
figure, then he made preparations for the
night. Quietly drawing off his boots, walked
across the room to the fireplace. Converted
his fingers into tongs, and so from the coalbox
noiselessly replenished the fire. Then he
sat down to watch; to watch and think.</p>

<p class="indent">For hours he sat there without stirring.
Made no movement lest he should disturb
the sleepers. He was over-anxious perhaps&mdash;afraid
to make the smallest sound.</p>

<p class="indent">His reflections were not altogether in the
groove they had followed hitherto. He had
felt certainty where now he felt doubt.
There were, too, throbbing moments when
he doubted not the woman, but himself.</p>

<p class="indent">But ever the truth, the bitter truth, rose
up before him, like a great black veil. In it
was no loophole for charity. Besides, love
asks for love&mdash;not for compassion. Could
she know what was in his mind, she would
scornfully refuse his pity. He knew that;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
had no doubt of it, low as he deemed her to
have fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">She would reject so poor a substitute for
love, and she would be right. There would
be no hesitation; he knew that instinctively.
He had once seen the blaze of anger in those
now closed eyes; the memory remained
with him. Yet that substitute was all he
had to offer her; all he felt for her now&mdash;so
he told himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it? Was it in very truth? He asked
himself the question, and his throbbing
heart made answer. But his lips formed
another reply, although unspoken. They
were tightly shut, firmly set. The tenseness
was the reply itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet&mdash;he could not help it&mdash;he wondered
whether it could be possible. That the
woman, from whose face he scarcely took his
eyes, was what he thought her. Whose
emotion and love for her child had been so
real and earnest, whose gratitude had shown
itself in her humility to him. To him! He
who had so grossly insulted her that night
on the seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in sleep, tell-tale sleep, when that
watchful control which we may keep on our
waking expression is no longer possible,
even then the lines of her face were all of
purity and gentleness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
The lips were closed in sweet soft curves;
a faint flush was on her pale cheeks; her
white brow was wholly serene. It was surely
as innocent a face as the little one&#39;s to which&mdash;he
saw it now for the first time&mdash;it bore so
striking a likeness. Was it possible that
a woman could sin, or be sinned against,
and remain unsullied?</p>

<p class="indent">When the time for medicine came round
again, he gently touched the child with intent to
waken her. Then drew away his hand. He felt
that she was so much cooler, the flush had
almost gone from her face, that he determined
not to disturb her. To let her awaken
of her own accord.... So the night passed.</p>

<p class="indent">During all those long hours, Masters might
have applied wisdom to a grasping of the
situation. But it has been well said that
wisdom does not pour knowledge from above
as the clouds let down rain. It is to be delved
for patiently and with hard toil, at the cost of
flinty hands and, mayhap, of skinned
knuckles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE BREAKING OF THE DAY</h3>

<p class="indent">The eastern sky was painted rosier and
rosier; day broke. Still the sleepers
slept, and the watcher watched. Never
moved he except when need arose to feed the
fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Seven o&#39;clock. Eight o&#39;clock. Then
Gracie woke. Gracie, save for weakness, her
own bright, clear-headed, intelligent little
self. He was once more making up the fire.
Turned round at the sound of her voice, to
find her sitting up in bed laughing at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Prince Charlie! I&#39;m ashamed of you!
You dir-ty boy! Don&#39;t you know what tongs
are made for?"</p>

<p class="indent">Then she laughed at him again! A faint
little laugh though, and so exhausting that
after it she fell back on the pillows, scant of
breath.</p>

<p class="indent">The laugh aroused the mother, trained by
love to awaken at the least sound. She
sprang to her feet and hastened to the bedside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
When she saw the change for the better in her
child, the smile on the little face, thankfulness
overwhelmed her.</p>

<p class="indent">Never had waking moments been more
sweet. It was less like waking than like a
dream itself. She hugged Gracie to her
bosom; just escaped crying over her.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters smilingly humoured the child&mdash;a
little tyranny is a welcome sign in a patient;
said, suiting the action to the word:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ll use the coal scoop, as you
object so to my hands."</p>

<p class="indent">"Look at your fingers! Isn&#39;t he a dirty boy,
mamma? I mustn&#39;t let him touch my clean
nightgown, must I?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was a challenge! Masters saw through
the ruse. Her desire was that he should
make pretence he wanted to catch hold of her.
Then she would struggle to escape him. It
was a game she was very fond of&mdash;he was to
catch her after a long while&mdash;and then the
romp would begin all over again. Fearing
to excite her, he took no notice of the thrown-down
glove; merely remarked:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you look all the better for your
sleep." Added, with a smile: "Both of you,
I mean."</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s heart was too full to speak.
Her child was hers once more. Had come
back to her from out the Valley of the Shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
of Death. After a long pause she managed
to look up at him, tears bedewing her eyes,
and inquire:</p>

<p class="indent">"And you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t worry about me! I am as right as
right can be. Just let me go to your bath-room,
will you? I shall emerge from it as
fresh as the proverbial lark."</p>

<p class="indent">"You will stop to breakfast&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie caught the suggestion in a moment;
interposed eagerly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, Prince Charlie! You will!
Won&#39;t you? Have breakfast with me&mdash;out
of my own tea service."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. I&#39;ll have a bath, and then
come and breakfast with you, Gracie&mdash;out of
your very own cups and saucers and plates.
That&#39;s understood."</p>

<p class="indent">He went to the bath-room. His matutinal
cold water sponge was a thing he would have
missed dreadfully. During his absence, the
doctor paid an early morning visit.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was pleased when he returned to
the sick room to see the happy look on the
mother&#39;s face. Gracie was out of danger the
doctor had said. Was going on splendidly&mdash;thanks,
she said, to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"To Prince Charlie, mamma! I heard the
doctor say so. He&#39;s a fairy prince who comes
and saves little girls."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
Gracie held Prince Charlie with one hand;
her mother&#39;s with the other, as she spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">"Prince Charlie, I want to kiss you."</p>

<p class="indent">He submitted to the wish of the little
autocrat. Both her arms went round his
neck as she gave him what she called her
extra nicest.</p>

<p class="indent">After that there was a happy breakfast
party. The cups were very small; Gracie,
propped up with pillows, had to fill them many
times. But that was just as well; the greater
demand, the greater her pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">The plates, too, were not quite large enough
to hold ordinary slices of bread and butter.
But then, as Gracie explained, you could hold
your bread in your hands, couldn&#39;t you?</p>

<p class="indent">As for the cups, small cups were very
fashionable&mdash;mamma had told her so. It
wasn&#39;t good manners to eat and drink too
much; even if you were ever so hungry.
But it was quite good form to say the tea was
hot even if it was quite cold. That was part
of the game.</p>

<p class="indent">The child&#39;s daily improvement was of the
rapid kind. In less than a week she was
skipping about the room. In ten days, well
wrapped up, was playing&mdash;literally skipping&mdash;on
the sun-lit sands.</p>

<p class="indent">And during the ten days? The author and
the mother drifted apart! As the child&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
convalescence became assured his visits grew
less in number; shorter in length.</p>

<p class="indent">From visiting three times a day his calls
came down to once. His usual hour&#39;s visits
were curtailed. He stayed but a quarter of
that time.</p>

<p class="indent">When the child asked a reason, he was busy,
he said. But the mother, listening, was not
for a moment deceived. Read in his eyes
that there had been no removal of his doubt
of her. Her pride rose&mdash;rose higher and
higher and higher day by day.</p>

<p class="indent">Her struggle was a hard one, to keep the
bitter resentful feeling down. She endeavoured
to stifle it with thought of the gratitude
she owed him. But it was hard, terribly hard.
She was not of a lachrymose temperament at
all, but her eyes often tear-filled when she
thought of him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was cold to her; grew more so; coldly
courteous and reserved. Instinctively he
feared his own weakness. Kept so close a
guard upon himself, so firm a brake upon his
feelings, that intercourse with him became
depressing and wearying.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no longer the old easy flow of
talk; words came with difficulty; conversation
was an effort on both sides. Forced
conversation is usually a failure.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw clearly that but for his love for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
child&mdash;and that, she knew, was genuine&mdash;he
would not have come to the house at all. She
felt that all the while he spoke to her courteously
and politely, he was suspicious of her.
She showed nothing of her indignation; that
would only have been acknowledgment of the
hit.</p>

<p class="indent">Suspicious of what? She asked herself;
asked not once, but a hundred times a day.
Her pride would not allow her to put the
question to him; so they drifted further and
further apart. To her it seemed as with
Ichabod: the glory had departed.</p>

<p class="indent">Sorry? She was heart-broken over it. She
had not learned to love him: she had cared
for him all along. More even than she had
known, more than she knew even now. The
sweet, helpful gentleness of his care for her
child when sick, had shown him in a light in
which few women would have failed to admire&mdash;nay,
more than that: to love him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a veritable Prince to her; she could
have worshipped him. Her soul had gone
out to him&mdash;and his to her&mdash;so naturally she
had scarce noticed its passage. She felt
she had known him all her life; so perfectly
their thoughts and views seemed to dovetail
one another.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been no shaping and moulding
and rubbing off of corners; no making of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
rough edges to fit evenly; all that is usually
the work of time. It is said that there is no
soul but somewhere on this crowded earth
another soul responds unto its needs. The
meeting is still a rarity, but kindly old Time
goes on with his everlasting pruning and
polishing and planing down to suit mutual
requirements.</p>

<p class="indent">He has them&mdash;has the man with the scythe
and hour glass&mdash;in his workshop; hundreds
and thousands of young couples. He lets
them rub along together, Fate having joined
them, until the roughnesses are all worn away
and it is scarcely noticeable&mdash;certainly not by
the young people themselves&mdash;that they were
not expressly made for each other.</p>

<p class="indent">The manufactured article produced in that
workshop of Old Time is durable and generally
gives satisfaction. Looks so much like the
real thing that most people want nothing
better. Some people prefer it even, take more
pride in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides, the Merchandise Marks Act is not
in force in regard to this particular class of
goods, so there is not much loss. It all bears
the same label, and there is no penalty for
deceiving the public. It is all marked&mdash;hall
marked: Love.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, however, it happens that two
souls come together whom Nature has really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
designed and moulded each to each. It is
fraught with much sweetness, such a meeting;
sweetness as of music. The harmonies are so
perfect and so pure, it seems no power in
Heaven or Earth could destroy the enduring
melody by a jarring note.</p>

<p class="indent">The swelling tones would rise and fall and
echo, long after the discordance had subsided.
Real love is very rare, rarer than gold and
diamonds, but it is found sometimes. In
out-of-the-way places, too; wholly unsought,
conjoining the hearts of man and woman by
the closeness and perfection of their union and
coincidence.</p>

<p class="indent">She had come to think, and he had thought
so, too, that God had framed them so, the
one to the other. Fight the idea as she would,
in her woman&#39;s weakness she thought so still.
He, in his manly strength, endeavoured to
crush the thought as it rose in his bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was there to crush.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>PLAYING THE SPY</h3>

<p class="indent">When the child had passed all the signposts
on the road of convalescence,
had reached perfect health, Masters ceased his
visits to the bungalow. His interest in Gracie
induced him not to avoid meeting her on the
front.</p>

<p class="indent">The child was all warmth and affection and
love for the man she was going to marry.
The mother hid her aching heart behind a
smile: a woman&#39;s usual veil. It was not
what a novelist describes as a sad sweet smile;
it had degenerated into an hysterical, jerky,
clattering, little laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">The weather continued fine; the author
prolonged his stay. For that reason&mdash;anyway,
for his own satisfaction he set down that as
the cause&mdash;he stayed on at Wivernsea.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a day passed but he met his little
sweetheart. Not a day passed but the breach
between the man and woman widened. Soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
the conventional greeting at meeting and
parting came to be dreaded by each.</p>

<p class="indent">They dared not look into each other&#39;s eyes.
As hands met for those two brief moments,
each involuntarily looked away from the
other. Fingers were clasped limply; fell
away awkwardly. Heartiness, even of the
faintest description, was sadly lacking in the
shake.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning he had a letter from his
lawyers. It called for his attendance in
London; a question of making an affidavit
over some copyright infringement. He
resolved to catch the fast train up, and so be
able to get back by the fast evening train
down.</p>

<p class="indent">He was at the station early, having inquiries
to make. A parcel of books sent down to
him had, by reason of the railway company&#39;s
vagaries, not reached him. Those inquiries
made and satisfied, he purchased newspapers.</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. Smith and Son occupied a space in
the booking office. As he dealt with the
juvenile representative of the great Strand
firm, he was standing with his back to the
ticket pigeon-hole. He was presently startled
by hearing a voice he recognized, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"First-class, return, London, please."</p>

<p class="indent">He turned round sharply, expecting to see
the mistress of Ivy Cottage; he could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
sworn to her voice anywhere. A woman
plainly dressed, almost shabbily, with a long
thick veil, stood purchasing the ticket. She
repeated the demand; the ticket seller had not
caught the words.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearing it a second time, Masters had no
shadow of doubt about the voice&#39;s owner.
There were no two voices like it in the world.
But the costume amazed him; could only be
explained one way.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a pleasant way, either. It was a
disguise! Masters felt certain of it. She had
always been well, expensively dressed. Now,
by reason of that, the change was the more
striking.</p>

<p class="indent">There were three minutes before the train
was due; five minutes passed before it
arrived. The shabbily-dressed woman paced
the platform. Masters watched her from the
waiting-room window; five minutes of utter
misery.</p>

<p class="indent">The station bell rang a second time, the
train came in. The veiled woman hurried
to a first-class carriage in front of the train.
The guard opened a door and she entered one
of its compartments. A moment after
Masters had entered another.</p>

<p class="indent">His purchases at the bookstall lay on the
seat beside him all the way to London; he
did not read a line of them. For two whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
hours he sat stonily looking out of the window,
thinking. Thinking, as well as the numb
feeling of wretchedness and horror holding
him would allow.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the first really cold day of the
approaching winter. With a view to travelling
in comfort, Masters had unpacked, and
was wearing a long heavy ulster. It changed
his appearance altogether. He knew that,
and, bred of the knowledge, there came a
desire to track the woman in the other compartment.</p>

<p class="indent">With his coat-collar up, she would not be
likely to recognize him. It would be possible
to follow her and see what this mysterious
disguise and flight to London meant; whether
she was really as black as his suspicion painted
her, as appearances represented her.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it a gentlemanly thing to do?...
He did not pause to answer his own question.
Curiosity and the desire, the necessity, to
either set at rest or confirm his fears outweighed
everything. Any certainty is better
than suspense; we always say so and feel it
so&mdash;until that certainty is known.</p>

<p class="indent">His mind was quickly made up: to follow
her. Besides, how could he tell but what she
might have need of him; the disguise led to
the thought of such a possibility. Masters&#39;
was a fertile brain; a dozen such possibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
entered his mind at once. Disguise very
frequently meant danger. If that were the
case it was his duty, as a man, to shield her.</p>

<p class="indent">He would not fail her&mdash;so he argued with
himself. A desire to do any particular thing
causes us to find reasons for its justification;
excellent reason. He had made up his mind
to follow her.</p>

<p class="indent">At Charing Cross the woman in the front
part of the train alighted.... Got into a
hansom cab.... Masters got into another.
A disturbing recollection came to him of a
private detective in one of his own books who
had acted in similar fashion. But he was not
deterred by it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">Through the trap in the cab roof the inquiry
came. Looking up he answered the driver:</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep that hansom in sight. I want to
see, and not be seen&mdash;do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m fly."</p>

<p class="indent">As the Jehu answered he shut one eye.
Then, as he closed the trap, said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">"Man from the Yard&mdash;what&#39;s she been
a-doin&#39; of, I wonder?"</p>

<p class="indent">The first cab went over Westminster Bridge,
turned into Lambeth, pulled up outside a
corner public house. The second cab slowed
down and passed the first at walking pace.
The woman was paying her fare. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
entered a door on the glass panels of which
were inscribed the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">BOTTLE AND JUG DEPARTMENT</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Masters&#39; cabman knew his business;
promptly reined in his horse just round the
corner.</p>

<p class="indent">"That do you, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">He put the question as Masters alighted,
and was feeling in his trousers pocket;
the driver continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s gone into the <i>Green Dragon</i> round
the corner, she has. We passed the pub a
minute agone."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters winced. Then reflected that the
cabman was only fulfilling his duty zealously.
Rewarded him with a half-sovereign.</p>

<p class="indent">"Going back, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">Golden fares are rare enough to be worth
looking after for a return journey.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps&mdash;I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll be stopping here, sir&mdash;here, for half-an-hour
if you should want me, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters nodded.... Passed through a
door brass-plated with the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">HOTEL ENTRANCE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A flight of stairs faced him. To the left
was another door, glass-lettered with the
word:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">SALLOON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Into the saloon Masters went. Square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
panels of bevelled ground glass pivoted on
their centres along the top of the bar, shielding
the occupants of the saloon from the gaze
of those in the opposite bar.</p>

<p class="indent">As he entered, Masters heard the woman
he had followed enquiring over the bar:</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Rigby? He is staying here&mdash;he
expects me."</p>

<p class="indent">The hesitation in the enquiring voice made
the barman look up. Nervousness in women
is rather an uncommon thing to find in the
bar of a Surrey-side public-house.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. But you&#39;ve come in the wrong
way. Round the corner and in at the hotel
entrance. You&#39;ll find him on the second
floor, room 15."</p>

<p class="indent">She went out. The bar-tender crossing to
him, Masters called for a whisky and soda.
Tasted, then tilted the glass, and let the
contents be soaked up by the sawdust on the
floor. It was not a drink which he thought
likely to benefit him. The Lambeth blend
of whisky did not somehow seem to tickle
his palate.</p>

<p class="indent">Watching through the saloon door, he
presently saw the veiled woman come in
through the hotel entrance, and ascend the
stairs. Allowing half-a-minute to elapse, he
passed out and followed in her steps.
As he commenced the ascent of the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
flight he heard a door close; guessed it to be
the door of room No. 15.</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching the passage on the second floor
he noted that the door of room No. 14 was shut.
No. 15 was shut too. No. 16 was open. He
paused on its threshold. Cast an eye round;
not a soul was in the passage; entered. Then
the door of No. 16 was shut too; shut, and the
key turned on the inside.</p>

<p class="indent">A hurried glance satisfied him that it was
an unoccupied room. He was glad of that;
an explanation that he had entered to wash
his hands would suffice, should need of
such excuse arise. All the rooms, he guessed,
were bedrooms on that floor.</p>

<p class="indent">A door was in the dividing wall of Nos. 15
and 16. To that Masters applied his ear. A
sense of the contemptibility of the action was
strong upon him; yet he could not refrain
from acting so.</p>

<p class="indent">Something crossed his mind about the end
justifying the means. It was a principle he
had always violently combated; practice
and theory are sometimes at variance. Shame
was merged into a feeling of gladness: that
there was no key in the lock; it made hearing
easier. And he meant to go the whole length;
to listen.</p>

<p class="indent">As he did so, reflected that such a despicable
act as eavesdropping would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
impossible to him a month ago. Suggested
to himself that she had brought him to it.</p>

<p class="indent">That is men&#39;s way&mdash;even the best of
them.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A HORRIBLE REVELATION</h3>

<p class="indent">The man she had inquired for in the bar,
Rigby&mdash;he guessed it was he&mdash;was
speaking. A husky-toned voice, but the
listener could plainly catch the words:</p>

<p class="indent">"There! Don&#39;t cry, old girl. I have
broken my promise to you, I know. You
thought I had gone out of England, and I
haven&#39;t. Well, I am going&mdash;going early to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Gospel truth, old girl. When I said
good-bye last time, I meant it. But I got in
with the boys and it was the old story. You
know; I needn&#39;t tell you. I don&#39;t blame the
boys; they think it a lark, that&#39;s all. First
one comes and then the other, and each one
doesn&#39;t know how far I&#39;ve gone already. I
have myself to blame; no one else. I have
been lying here over a fortnight with the
D.T.&#39;s&mdash;came out of them two days ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
Doctor says I shall be able to go abroad to-morrow.
He&#39;s a good sort; says the Mediterranean
cruise will be the thing to set me on
my legs. You said so; he says so. He has
been kind enough to see to things, booked my
berth, and I am going to-morrow from
St. Katharine&#39;s dock on <i>La Mascotte</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am speaking honest, old girl; I am
going. I might have gone without writing
to you to come up and see me, and you would
have been spared this, but I couldn&#39;t. I felt
that I wanted to say good-bye, old girl,
because&mdash;because you&#39;ve been so good to me&mdash;more
than I deserve. Because," there was a
quaver in the speaker&#39;s voice, "because I
believe it will be the last time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">The listener, a fierce pain at his heart,
heard the catch in her voice, the gasping way
in which she ejaculated the name. The man
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"It is possible to travel too far on the
downward road. So far that you get lost for
ever and ever in the valley. I have been
down a great big distance. There is a presentiment
in possession of me that, somehow, I
shall never come back to England. That I
shall never come back to worry you again!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick! Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
The listening man could hear the heart-breaking
sound; the woman&#39;s sobs as she
spoke. Despite Rigby, despite all, his heart
went out to her. Involuntarily he stretched
out his arms. They fell to his side again,
empty. There was the door between.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t cry. After all, it is perhaps for the
best. See what a failure I am. If I drink
myself to death perhaps it would be best.
Pity it takes so long, that&#39;s all. See how like
a blackguard I have behaved to you."</p>

<p class="indent">The listener could not see, but he knew her
actions to be expostulating.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, it&#39;s so; it&#39;s so.... I know; I&#39;m
sober now. When I come out of it I lie
thinking, thinking, thinking. Realize then
what a foul beast I have made of myself.
When I think how I have behaved to you&mdash;to
you, my staunch, devoted, dear old pal, the
one soul who has stuck to me through thick
and thin, I hate myself, I hate myself; and I
wonder you don&#39;t hate me too."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know I love you, Dick. You know
that no soul in the whole world loves you as
I do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Somehow I&#39;d rather see you fly into a
rage and call me all the evil names you could
invent than look at me so lovingly and sadly;
I would indeed. I should feel more that I
had deserved to lose you; it would hurt less.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
But I know you love me; that is one reason
why I have determined on trying this Mediterranean
trip. Do you know, before I sat
down to write to you yesterday, I made a
balance of my hands. Held the pen in one
and a razor in the other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick! Oh, for God&#39;s sake don&#39;t
talk so!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You would never have known, Mab. I
am staying here in the name of Rigby. You
don&#39;t read the police intelligence in the papers.
If you had, you would never have linked an
account of a drunkard&#39;s suicide in a Lambeth
hotel with me. You would have thought
me on blue water, keeping my promise to
you."</p>

<p class="indent">The man at the door could hear the sounds
of her grief still. It was agony to him; he
ground his teeth. That she should suffer so,
and he so close, so helpless to help her!</p>

<p class="indent">"The pen won the day, Queenie." The
speaker was trying to infuse a note of cheeriness.
"Don&#39;t cry, old girl; there is nothing
to cry about after all. I&#39;m here right enough.
I wrote you to come up; to say good-bye to
the man who has wronged you so. If I live
through the trip I shall come back a better,
sounder, healthier man. With the courage
to fight this drink devil for life or death, for
all I am worth."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
"And, please God, conquer him, Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And what about yourself, little woman?
Have you been ill? You look worn out,
worn and thinner. You haven&#39;t been worrying
about me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Dick; about Grace. She has been
ill; dying once, I thought, but thank God
she is as well to-day as ever she was."</p>

<p class="indent">"Our little Gracie has been as ill as all
that? Poor little soul! And I&#39;ve been
drinking from morning till night, selfish brute
that I am, without any thought for you or her.
Good God! Why was I born&mdash;answer me
that?"</p>

<p class="indent">The listening man had started back, horrified
at the speaker&#39;s use of the word, Our.
So stupefied was he that he hardly heard the
latter part of the man&#39;s speech. So, then,
this drink-sodden being, posturing under the
name of Rigby, was the father of Gracie! Of
the little girl he had helped to nurse back to
life.</p>

<p class="indent">He shook off the numbness which had
gripped him; there was more to hear. The
thread was taken up again; the mother was
speaking:</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;&mdash;for us to love each other dearly, Dick,
all through our lives. Let that be reason
enough. Banish those presentiments of yours,
dearest. Go bravely on this voyage. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
must benefit you, give you strength&mdash;moral
strength."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am a pretty nice sort of beauty to be
thinking of moral strength&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t turn away from me like that; I
can&#39;t bear it! Pray for strength, Dick;
pray for it! Oh, come back to me, Dick
dear, your old, old self. My heart aches for
you all the while you are away from
me. Come back to me, Dick, come back
to my loving arms, stronger and better&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m going to, old girl&mdash;going to try hard
this time. I can be stronger when I am away
from the boys. On board <i>La Mascotte</i> there
won&#39;t be a soul I shall know. It will be
torture for me to travel in solitude, for I don&#39;t
expect such a wreck as I am will make friends.
I carry my story written on my face; every
man can read it first glance. At the same
time, there will be safety in it. From the
time I set foot on deck till the time I come
back&mdash;if ever I come back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll only take claret; will not touch a
drop of spirits; so help me God!"</p>

<p class="indent">The listener thought he heard a sigh, a
despondent sigh, as the man uttered this
resolution; probably it had been so resolved
before. But it might have been fancy; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
dividing door was too thick for him to hear
with certainty.</p>

<p class="indent">"God will help you, Dick. He must. I
believe you, Dick, I believe you. You mean
well, and you will succeed. You will come
back, and we shall be happy. My dear, dear
old Dick; happy again, I know it."</p>

<p class="indent">"We will hope so, Queenie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Another man, Dick! A strong, healthy
and well man. And what I am praying to
see, Dick&mdash;for I think the tie will help
you to keep straight&mdash;well and able to
marry."</p>

<p class="indent">There ensued a moment&#39;s silence. The
listener&#39;s imagination supplied the gap. What
he had seen at the back of the bungalow at
Wivernsea helped him thereto. He heard the
passionate sobbing; the impact of their lips.
Then he heard no more.</p>

<p class="indent">A great blurring veil seemed to come over
sight, hearing, even faculty; to enshroud
him. He staggered away as if physically
injured. What he had heard hurt so.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other side of the door were Gracie&#39;s
mother, Gracie&#39;s father. And they were
talking of his coming back from a voyage well
enough to marry.</p>

<p class="indent">His thoughts went away. Were of that
sweet, innocent little child down at Wivernsea.
As she came before him he almost groaned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
it was too terrible, too horrible. Poor little
Gracie!</p>

<p class="indent">Trembling fingers unlocked the door; he
got downstairs somehow; down to the level
of the bar. Called for brandy there, and,
regardless of its quality, swallowed it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a mechanical act. Instinct told him
that he needed brandy, and he wanted to be
doing something; inaction at that moment
was maddening.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked outside.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE ONLY WAY</h3>

<p class="indent">The cabman was of a speculative nature.
Had hung on the chance of Masters&#39;
needing to return. Half-sovereign fares
are not picked up every hour in the day;
the man who dispensed them was worth
waiting for.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">The query called down through the trap
in the cab roof. The reply was:</p>

<p class="indent">"Back again."</p>

<p class="indent">Directions so given, because, for the moment,
the fare could think of nowhere else....
The cool air blowing on his face gradually
brought him back to his usual clear perception
of things; he remembered.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman he loved so, was lost and dead
to him; he quite realized that. Knew too
that he loved her still; would do anything
to ensure or bring about her happiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
Pity&mdash;heart-felt, whole-souled pity&mdash;was
mingled with his feeling for her now.</p>

<p class="indent">Pondering over his position, he came to
think of her as more sinned against than
sinning. Almost joined in the prayer that
the man she loved&mdash;whose existence was a
bar to his own success&mdash;might return well
enough to marry.</p>

<p class="indent">For Gracie&#39;s sake too&mdash;sweet, winsome
little Gracie! If the man returned well
enough to marry it would silence tongues.
Surely it was a good prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Gracie would grow up knowing
nothing of her childhood. No bar sinister
would, anyway, be apparent on her escutcheon.
She could travel her road in life
without a dark shadow o&#39;erhanging it.</p>

<p class="indent">If he returned well enough to marry!
Why shouldn&#39;t he? Or was he, in the solitude
which he feared, likely to become
despondent again? Was he not more liable
to be so, in abstinence from those accustomed
stimulants? Despondent even to the clutching
of a razor again?</p>

<p class="indent">What manner of man was he that had
stolen the heart of Gracie&#39;s mother? What
manner of man was he who could have
led astray so pure, so loving a soul?</p>

<p class="indent">Surely Rigby had spoken rightly; it were
best for such a man no longer to cumber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
the earth. And yet&mdash;that was not the only
consideration. There was another. Two:
Gracie and her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">The man had said that he feared solitude.
Had spoken of his personal appearance with
loathing. Had feared that no soul would
wish to speak to him; that Drink was written
on his face. Even allowing for exaggeration,
there must be a basis of truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it wise to let him spend that voyage
alone? Was it not possible to send with him
a companion? One who would interest him;
divert his thoughts; take him out of himself?</p>

<p class="indent">A companion to do this for her sake&mdash;for
her child&#39;s sake. Why not himself?
What was there in it after all? Not even
self-sacrifice. Masters felt that a voyage
would do him good. That to stop in England
just then, where he was, would stifle him.
Let him go on to the broad ocean where he
would be able to breathe.</p>

<p class="indent">His work he could take with him. Write
as well, better, on the ship than in his own
rooms. Why not? There was a soul to
help to save! There was a woman to be
made happy! A child to be taken out of the
range of the pointed finger of shame! Why
not?</p>

<p class="indent">If it were true, as the mother said, that
he had saved the child&#39;s life, was it to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
saved only that she should suffer misery
thereafter? Undeserved misery in all the
future years? Should he not prevent that
if he could?</p>

<p class="indent">Himself! Who better fitted? His heart
and soul would be in the act. He would be
working for those he loved! What a triumph
if he could restore this man to her Well
Enough To Marry. Why not?</p>

<p class="indent">Resolution: he would go. Yes, he would
go on to the boat: it was the only way. The
cab passed a bill-poster&#39;s hoarding. A drama
being played in London just then was: <i>The
Only Way</i>. The mind of the man in the cab
had run in keeping with the theatre announcement.
He thought of Sidney Carton.</p>

<p class="indent">He would go! The hero of that <i>Tale of
Two Cities</i> was not the only man who had
made sacrifices for the woman he loved;
although his own sacrifice was hardly worth
such a name. In his heart he wished it
greater.</p>

<p class="indent">The thought trembled through his mind,
result of the years of journalistic labour,
that his cruise would serve in affording
a supply of copy. He hated himself for the
thought; it seemed to sully the purity of his
motive, his love. He wanted to give to
the woman he loved whole-souled service.
Yet was weak enough to want an excuse.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Sidney Carton, when his good work was
accomplished, died on the scaffold. When
Masters had accomplished his good work&mdash;well,
there would be time enough to think of
that later.</p>

<p class="indent">Life was worth living just then: for her
sake. It would have little value to him after;
after its work was over. Then he would
be content, wishful to rest.</p>

<p class="indent">The cab had reached Parliament Street.
The fare&#39;s hand went through the roof trap;
the driver reined up.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is a passenger&mdash;ship&#39;s passenger&mdash;agent&#39;s,
somewhere round here," he called up
to the bending-down driver, "Cockspur Street,
I think; do you know it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"So many about, sir. Might you happen
to know the name, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"M&#39;no. Yes! I have just remembered
it: Sewell and Crowther."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes; I know the place, sir. Do you
want to drive there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the cab stopped and
he was alighting at the passenger agents&#39;
door. Entering, he said to the counter
clerk:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are booking for <i>La Mascotte</i>, leaving
for the Mediterranean, aren&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
"Yes, sir; we&#39;re the agents."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you any berths left?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, sir, a number. It&#39;s an off time of
the year, and we do not fill up from London.
We are stopping at coast stations. We shall
fill up from those."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me see a plan of the ship."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir.... That&#39;s it. Which class&mdash;which
part of the boat do you want,
sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters ignored the question. Pointing
to the pen and ink list of names, inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"These are the names of those who have
already booked their passages?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Having located what he wanted he turned
to the plan of the ship again, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"This is a two-berthed cabin. One berth
is taken, I see. Is the other vacant?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir. But you can book one in an
empty cabin if you like. You will have more
room, unless we fill up."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you. I prefer this one. I think
I happen to know the Mr. Rigby who has the
other half."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I see, sir&mdash;friend of yours&mdash;of course,
companionship. I beg your pardon."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters paid his passage money; booked in
the name of Charleigh; inquired the time
of sailing on the morrow.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
"Tide serves at noon, sir. The vessel
will go out on top of the water."</p>

<p class="indent">"From St. Katharine&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir.... Good-day, sir, and thank
you.... Not that way, sir.... This door on
the left.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-day."</p>

<p class="indent">The cabman was waiting. Stooped down
from his perch to receive instructions.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Telegraph Office, Charing Cross."</p>

<p class="indent">There the fare despatched a wire to his
Wivernsea landlady; telling her to pack
everything of his in his portmanteaux, and
send them up by the afternoon train to the
care of the Cloak Room, Charing Cross.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he drove to his publishers. He
would be away some time, and there
were certain business arrangements to be
made.... Then to his flat in Shaftesbury
Avenue. He slept there the night.</p>

<p class="indent">More correctly, he spent the night there.
Spent it in pacing to and fro, recalling all
the events of that long last month. All
the happiest days; all the most miserable
ones.</p>

<p class="indent">He was heart-full of pity for the woman,
poor soul! Wished he could wipe away the
bitterness of his words that night on the
seat at Wivernsea. That was impossible.
But he could try to make amends.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
In the early morning&mdash;dawn just lightening
the sky&mdash;he wrote a note to Gracie&#39;s
mother: directed it to Ivy Cottage. Just
a purely formal little letter, saying he was
called away on urgent business and would
not return to Wivernsea again.</p>

<p class="indent">As coming from an author it was a disappointing
note; there was nothing clever in
it. Most authors&#39; notes, perhaps because
literary fireworks are supposed to be contained
in them, are disappointing.</p>

<p class="indent">He sent his fondest love to his little sweetheart
Gracie, and expressed a sincere hope
for her mother&#39;s future happiness. That
letter later on in the morning he dropped into
a post office.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie&#39;s mother, who had journeyed home
by the previous evening&#39;s train, read it, dry-eyed.</p>

<p class="indent">The dryness which burns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>WHITE LIES</h3>

<p class="indent">Masters gathered in his luggage from
Charing Cross cloak room; reached St.
Katharine&#39;s Docks with it; got aboard <i>La
Mascotte</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">He was first in the cabin; was arranging
his things in an orderly way when Mr. Rigby
came aboard. The second tenant of the
cabin looked every bit of the wreck he had
painted himself.</p>

<p class="indent">The author, quick of observation, gauged
him to be a man of twenty-five or thereabouts.
Younger possibly, but dissipation
is an artist who graves deep lines; wrinkles
are ageing things. Still of fine physique,
but dull-eyed, heavy, face bluish and swollen.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters, sweeping a comprehensive glance
round, brushed up the new comer with it;
said generally:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am first to take possession. It seems
we are to be close companions on this voyage;
too close, in one sense."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
He referred to the size of the cabin;
then stretching out his hand, continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me introduce myself. William
Charleigh, journalist. I sincerely hope we
shall be very good friends whilst we are
together."</p>

<p class="indent">The gloom on Dick&#39;s face lighted; his
colourless horizon seemed brightened; it
was as if the sun had suddenly popped out.
This cheerful, strong-looking man making
overtures of friendship, dissipated all his
fearsomeness of solitude on the voyage.
Eagerly gripping the hand held out, he shook
it long and earnestly; saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"I reciprocate that! Thanks! My
name&#39;s Rigby. Nothing by profession and
very little better by nature. I have just
come out of&mdash;out of an illness. I am taking
the trip in the hope of&mdash;of getting well."</p>

<p class="indent">"No trip like it!" Masters&#39; response was
cheerily uttered. "Take my word for that.
I took the voyage some years ago, and it
pulled me off the grave&#39;s brink."</p>

<p class="indent">"Really! You look so strong and well
I should not have thought you&#39;d had an
illness in all the days of your life."</p>

<p class="indent">Lies, white lies, came to Masters&#39; lips with
the readiness of fiction flowing from his
pen; he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I went to the dogs and the dogs nearly did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
for me. That&#39;s an unpleasant way they
have when you get inside the kennel. It&#39;s
a mere shave I&#39;m here talking to you. I
pulled up just in time."</p>

<p class="indent">"No!"</p>

<p class="indent">There were both astonishment and eagerness
in Dick&#39;s question; both of the most
intense kind. Masters&#39; lying was very successful.
He was acting so with a view to drawing
his companion out.</p>

<p class="indent">If a confession could be got from the
sick man it would help. Dick would rely for
strength and help on the man he had confessed
to. That was only human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">If you tell a man your troubles he is more
than likely to want to tell you his own. A
keen observer was Masters; knew that
confidence begets confidence. So himself
became very confidential.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is a fact," he continued. "Like a
great number of others, I liked society,
and cards, and wine, and&mdash;well, I am quite
cured now, so I don&#39;t mind confessing it. I
sacrificed at the shrine of Bacchus too often,
and Bacchus resented it. The drink god
is an ungrateful sort of deity, isn&#39;t he? He
sent me visions of snakes and other creepy-crawlies.
When I came out of the land of
visions I was the most washed-out wreck
you ever saw. The doctor gave me up."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
"No?"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick ejaculated the word almost breathlessly.
His own doctor had not gone so far
as that. There was more than a chance of
hope, after all! He listened.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fact. When I heard that, I was on the
verge of suicide. Then they put me on a
boat doing the Mediterranean trip; just as
this one is. This brings back old times, and&mdash;well,
here I am, you see; I am all right
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"And the doctor, you say&mdash;but how did
you&mdash;did you conquer your craving?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sheer force of will. I took an oath
that whilst I was on the ship I wouldn&#39;t
touch a drop."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have done that, too!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters started round in astonishment:
really a clever piece of acting.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes.... Well, the cat&#39;s out of the bag
now. Thank God I haven&#39;t got a temperance
crank for a companion on the voyage. I
have done what you have done, and I am
setting out to do now what you did: coming
away to get shut of it all. To try and break
myself free from the curse."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll do it!"</p>

<p class="indent">The flushed face flushed still deeper;
deepened to purple, at the assurance. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
the dulled eyes had quite an eager light in
them, as the speaker pressed his question:</p>

<p class="indent">"You think I will? You really think I
will? That I have strength enough?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course! It&#39;s the despondent times
you have to fear; just don&#39;t fear them.
Just hang on to me when you feel them
coming. Don&#39;t get by yourself; it&#39;s like
taking one&#39;s pill uncoated; cling to me
like a barnacle. I&#39;ll help you to kill your blue
devils!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You will? By God!" He spoke almost
breathlessly; the proffered help was so sweet:
hit him in the face. "You&#39;re a brick!
And a stranger, too; never set eyes on me
before!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never. Quite right; never set eyes on
you before! But remember, we&#39;ve been burnt
in the same fire. A fellow-feeling makes us&mdash;you
know the rest."</p>

<p class="indent">"By Jove! You are wondrous kind. Do
you know, I funked this voyage; funked it
believing there was death aboard&mdash;overboard&mdash;for
me. Imagined every soul would read
the story in my face and shun me. People
are so apt to judge the quality of a pasture
by the length of the grass."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rot!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was shuddering inwardly as he
looked at his companion. This bloated youth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
who looked five-and-twenty, yet spoke with
the boyishness of eighteen. He dived into
his secret apprehension; shuddered to think
that the woman he loved should be linked to
such a drink-sodden wretch. Thought of her
induced him to lower the sail of his dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">There was the hope, the chance, of reformation.
When Rigby set foot on the vessel
it had been with despair at his heart; he
had attended the funeral of hope long ago.
Things were different now. As for Masters,
he realized that the man was young; might
perhaps still meet with salvation.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was a thin reed on which to rely:
his youth; a two-edged fact: might cut
either way. Masters was quite aware of that
as he uttered the reassuring monosyllable.
Spoke in a forced tone of conviction; there
is a limit to suffering; none to fear.</p>

<p class="indent">The odds, too, are against a drunkard&#39;s
reformation; all Lombard Street to a China
orange. Anyway, it was a fact he was going
to do his level best to turn things to good
account. The youngster must be spurred
on; not to advance is to retreat. Not only
is courage needed in facing a difficulty,
but the ability to grapple with it; if looked
in the face too long, it is apt to stare us out of
countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe you." Rigby spoke with grateful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
fervour. "Anyway, I am not going to
face the future gloomily now!"</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s half the battle. After all, life&#39;s
only a journey; it&#39;s more or less our own
fault if we don&#39;t make a pleasure excursion of
it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know it. Remember, I have been in the
battle, and came out upper dog. So long
as you win the race, what does it matter
whether you had a good start or not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Anyway, I shall keep you to your word.
If I feel that awful thirst coming on me;
feel, as I have felt, that Hell&#39;s got its doors
gaping wide open for me, I shall worry you."</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t; not worry me. Come that
moment you hear the hinges start creaking,
and we&#39;ll try, try together, to keep the doors
shut."</p>

<p class="indent">"That you should take all this trouble&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Trouble be hanged! Don&#39;t you know
how easy it is to poke another man&#39;s fire?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters&#39; eyes looked honestly into Dick&#39;s;
he was very honest of purpose. Wanted,
with all his soul, to keep those doors closed.
For the sake of the woman whose trust had
been betrayed; for the sake of the little
one. He knew how facile is the descent
into Hell. Knew, too, that a man ambitious
to make a fool of himself never lacks help.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
How shines a good deed in this bad world!
The goodness of his own was illuminating
Masters&#39; eyes at that moment. And he had
no fear of the proverb: that if he conferred a
favour he might expect ingratitude. Plainly,
Rigby was not built on those lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was not much of a psychologist or
mind reader. Saw only the honest eyes
bright with enthusiasm; found them inspiriting;
knew nothing of the inner thought
prompting this extraordinary kindness.</p>

<p class="indent">His was not an inquiring nature; in his
happy-go-lucky way he accepted Fate unquestionably.
Help had come in his way,
and he snapped at it as suddenly as if it
were a dish of snapdragon. In response to
Masters&#39; words, he mentally thanked his
stars, physically held out his hand. In
silence, gratefully gripped his companion;
was too thankful to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters resumed his assumption of cheerfulness.
Knew the difficulty he had to face before
he spoke: putting seed into the ground
does not make a harvest certain; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, there is another thing to discuss:
about the grub."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear old chap!" Earnestness, conviction
in his tone. "I feel as if I shouldn&#39;t
touch food again for months."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know. That&#39;s not an unusual symptom."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
Masters affected to laugh. "I felt
like that. And if you go to the saloon table
you&#39;ll feel like it for quite a while. Look
here now!" He spoke suddenly, as if inspired
with an idea. "Will you leave your
commissariat to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To you! But why on earth, now, should
you be troubled to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters let a shade of annoyance creep
over his face. There was no misreading it.
Assuming, too, a tone of regret; he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean that? That you would rather
I did not interfere?"</p>

<p class="indent">The facial expression and voice had the
desired effect. Cheated the younger man&mdash;surely
he must be very young!&mdash;into expostulating:</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear old chap! For Heaven&#39;s sake
don&#39;t think I mean anything of that sort! I&#39;ll
do whatever you say."</p>

<p class="indent">So he would; that was plainly evident.
The strong will had conquered the weaker.
Masters felt overjoyed at his success. Most
hearts have secret drawers in them containing
some good traits: if we can only find the
spring.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, strange as it seemed, Masters was
conscious of the birth of a liking for his young
companion. He was surprised, too, to realize
that he was but a boy. Had thought him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
five-and-twenty at first; now imagined him
to be not much over one-and-twenty years of
age&mdash;if that.</p>

<p class="indent">It was, in a measure, a welcome surprise.
His imagination had portrayed Rigby as a
hardened debauchee; sunken in vice as sodden
in drink. Mingled with the surprise, too, was
a feeling of wonder that Gracie&#39;s mother
should, with one younger than herself&mdash;&mdash;But
there, he told himself, there was no
accounting for these things; there was no logic
or reason in them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, then"&mdash;Masters speaking, his
face cleared of its cloud&mdash;"I&#39;ll arrange
with the steward and the cook. Fresh milk,
while it lasts, and beef tea right away till
you feel you can compass solidity little and
often; that is my prescription."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are a good old chap!"</p>

<p class="indent">Almost tears in his eyes as he spoke. He
had not counted on making friends at all,
and here, the moment he set foot on the
boat, was one to hand. And such a one! A
perfect prince of good fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">"For some days," Dick continued, "I
shall keep almost to this cabin. Lying down
will rest me. Moreover, I am not anxious to
show up to the crowd."</p>

<p class="indent">Again that purple flush. Masters, considerately,
was not looking. Was engaged hanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
up his belongings and stowing them away
in the limited space at his disposal. It
was work which afforded occasion for a
considerable display of invention and ingenuity.</p>

<p class="indent">The cabin of a three thousand ton vessel,
or of an Atlantic liner for that matter, offers
little luxury in the way of wardrobe accommodation.
Masters, though his personal
luggage did not rival in extent that of Beau
Brummel, yet found himself in difficulties. He
turned to his companion; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be inside a lot too. As a matter
of fact, I&#39;m finishing a book; have a lot of
writing to do. So you won&#39;t be altogether
alone."</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s jolly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lend a hand here, old fellow, will
you? See if we can shove this portmanteau
under."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was only too glad to be of service;
willingly rendered aid in the stowing away of
things. Later followed suit with his own
stuff. Masters was intent on keeping his
companion occupied even with the smallest
matters.</p>

<p class="indent">That was the beginning of things. The
author felt that he had got the bit in his
companion&#39;s mouth; that it rested with him
which road was taken; depended on his skill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
as a rider. Still there was every care and
caution to be exercised.</p>

<p class="indent">When you ride a young colt it is well
to see that your saddle is well girt.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>LOVE&#39;S LABOUR LOST</h3>

<p class="indent">Prosperity attended the voyage; if
that term may be applied to recovery of
health. The sea-air&mdash;genial companionship had
something to do with it&mdash;was pulling Dick
round. He said he was a new man; received
assurance of that fact from inspection of his
reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">Although his story was no longer visible
on his face, it was in his heart; hidden away
perhaps, but there still. He had left the
stepping-stones of milk and beef-tea a long
way behind; was walking through square
meals as vigorously as any man aboard.</p>

<p class="indent">The friendship opened up in the little two-berth
cabin had developed into the closest
kind. On one side it had started garbed
in the mantle of pretence. That was soon
shed; sincerity taking its place.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s fidelity was dog-like; he followed his
companion about as if loath to lose sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
of him. Masters had discovered in him
artistic tendencies; the ability to draw well.
It was long before Dick&#39;s hand ceased to
remind one of a jelly; when it did, Masters
asked, would Dick oblige him by doing
something?</p>

<p class="indent">Oblige him? Dick repeated the question.
Great Scott! Was there anything he could
ask which he, Dick, wouldn&#39;t jolly well jump
at the chance of doing. What did Charleigh
take him for?</p>

<p class="indent">The story Masters was engaged on was to
be illustrated; sketches were needed of the
proposed drawings. So the author said,
speaking quite casually.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, he was anxious to
find occupation for idle hands. Feared the
provision, if he did not himself provide it,
of less profitable work. Remembered a
proverb to that effect: Satan filling a stellar
part in it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me make them for you, will you?"
Dick spoke eagerly. "I can draw properly,
really; I&#39;ve had drawings in the <i>Strand</i> and
<i>Windsor</i>, and they&#39;re particular, you know.
I did it because I loved the work; I had to
give it up, because my hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters interrupted him; was ever anxious
to prevent a harking back to the old days of
failure. Wanted his protégé to look forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
not backward: at the brightness ahead, not
on the horror which he hoped was for ever
left behind.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Dick, a thousand thanks! I
shall be only too glad if you will."</p>

<p class="indent">That was the commencement of an even
closer intercourse; the drawings drew them
together. The sketches had to be thought
out and considered. On smooth days were
worked at with pencil on paper.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s was really a skilled hand. And that
hand of his&mdash;he took immense pride in the
fact&mdash;was steady now. The ability is not
given to every artist to do line work on a
boat. The throbbing from the engine room
usually permeates every part of the vessel.</p>

<p class="indent">So the two men would sit on deck, one
writing and the other drawing. Sometimes
the author&#39;s pen would suddenly cease work;
cease for quite a while. Dick respected those
pauses; imagined Charleigh to be thinking
out the details of his work.</p>

<p class="indent">He was wrong. Masters was thinking of
Miss Mivvins. Remorseful thoughts; remorse
that he had ever wounded that generous,
sweet soul; ever added by his harsh words
to her burden of sorrow. Vainly regretful
thoughts: regret that he had not met her
earlier in life. A sigh usually marked Masters&#39;
emergence from dreamland. If he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
directly pick up his work again, his companion
would open up conversation; one day said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I call you Prince, old fellow, because
you told me to. Is it a nickname or your
real name?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters smiled; the sweet innocence of
his godmother occurred to him; he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Which do you think, now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I can&#39;t help thinking that Prince
Charleigh seems too happy a combination
to be the real thing. Real godmothers
and godfathers don&#39;t hit on those things
usually."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mine did not. Yet all the same I was
christened, quite recently, Prince."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" Dick&#39;s eyes sparkled; he fancied
himself a discoverer. "I&#39;ll bet you a
new hat I can guess the sex of the christener&mdash;a
girl?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Splendid marksman! A bull&#39;s eye! Hit
the centre of the target first time!"</p>

<p class="indent">A merry twinkle found place in the younger
man&#39;s eyes as he inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Engaged to her, old fellow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters paused. Then, with a quiet smile
and a long puff at his pipe, completed his
sentence:</p>

<p class="indent">"We have spoken of marriage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Soon?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
"M&#39;no. She&#39;s very young."</p>

<p class="indent">The quiet smile broadened on Masters&#39;
face; he remembered how very young!</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been writing this morning to my
girl," said Dick. "We shall touch port today
for stores, and be able to post letters,
the Captain says."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I gathered."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did your ears burn this morning, old
chap? My letter was full of you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters started; was troubled. His pipe
was being smoked more vigorously than
ever; he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am sorry for that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why? I told my girl who was responsible
for my salvation. You.... Ah, don&#39;t
shake your head, Prince. My living, my
being here on this deck alive, sane, and, thank
God! with a feeling of manhood strong in me,
is due to you. But for you, I should have
gone overboard.... Yes, I know it; I want
you to know that I know it. I can never
repay you, that&#39;s out of the region of possibility,
but you might like to feel that you
took a fellow-creature out of the slough,
even if the fellow isn&#39;t worth much. You
saved my life and you&#39;ve made it worth
living&mdash;to me, at any rate."</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke with a catch in his voice; gratitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
moved him. So earnest was his speech
of thankfulness that it moved Masters also;
Dick went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"I came aboard with the knowledge in my
heart that I should make a hole in the water.
I got my girl up to London, the only friend
that has stuck to me, to say good-bye to her.
And I meant it, Prince; meant it for a final
good-bye, a good-bye for ever. Thanks to
you, old chap, that&#39;s a thing of the past; the
shadow has passed away."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope, Dick&mdash;nay, more than hope&mdash;I
am confident, never to return."</p>

<p class="indent">"I pray God so, Prince! I do! I do! I
say that reverently. I pray God so. I&#39;m
a bit fearful of when this trip is over; just a
bit; that&#39;s all that&#39;s wrong with me. You&#39;ve
been my anchor; I don&#39;t know how I shall
ride on a tempting sea without you. You
are not as other men&mdash;no, let me say it&mdash;I
have clung to you, Prince, old fellow, like&mdash;well,
like the ivy clings to the oak. I can&#39;t
help thinking, when the oak&#39;s gone what&#39;s to
become of the ivy."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll go back home well, and find
other ties."</p>

<p class="indent">Then he gave utterance to the phrase
which had been persistently ringing in his
ears so long:</p>

<p class="indent">"You will go back well enough to marry."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
Dick started; smiled. The memory of that
last interview came back to him too; he
answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s what my girl says, Prince. But I
don&#39;t feel at all like marrying: I&#39;m not that
sort."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not&mdash;that&mdash;sort!"</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to Masters as if all the blood
in his body suddenly turning scalding hot
and black-coloured; filled his veins to
bursting point. He sat quite still, motionless;
fearful that if he moved, loosened
for one instant his hold on himself, his feelings
would be too much for him.</p>

<p class="indent">His trip, his care for Dick then, was so
much labour thrown away.... He must
keep that feeling, that desire to rush at the
boy&#39;s throat and choke his worthless life
out, keep it down. Nothing would be gained
by loss of temper. It is the cool hammer
which fashions the red-hot iron; he knew
that, yet did not dare to look at his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">His stylographic pen was not of the best
make; perhaps resented being held down
so. The ink ran from it and made a blot
on the paper. Although conscious of its
existence he allowed the size of the blot
to increase; still he made no movement....
At last he spoke; spoke so huskily that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
Dick looked up from his sketch. The moment
he did so, he cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Prince! Good God, old chap, what&#39;s the
matter? Prince! Prince! You are ill!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am quite well. Sit down; I am all right
I tell you. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rot!"</p>

<p class="indent">The boy scrambled to his feet impatiently,
looking in amazement at the white, drawn
expression on his companion&#39;s face; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re ill. Think I am blind? Come
to the cabin and lie down."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sit down."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not for half a second!"</p>

<p class="indent">As he answered he was cramming
the drawing materials into his pocket; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"If you want to talk come into the cabin
and lie down. I&#39;ll talk to you there till the
doctor comes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Doctor! Don&#39;t be absurd! I am all
right. I want to talk to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then come right along into the cabin out
of this sun; talk there. It&#39;s my turn to give
orders. I&#39;m going."</p>

<p class="indent">He moved away as he spoke, throwing a
glance over his shoulders: an anxious look.
He was fearing greatly for the man whom he
had grown to love.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
Masters rose; staggered up really. That
hot black blood seemed to rise with him,
right up to his brain. Had the effect of
making things go whirling round and round
for a minute. Then with an immense effort he
pulled himself together. Better perhaps in the
cabin, out of earshot.</p>

<p class="indent">He must have his talk out with Master
Dick.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>RESTORED SIGHT</h3>

<p class="indent">Dick led the way; Masters followed; the
cabin was reached. The moment they
had entered, the author put his back against
the door; spoke with a gravity which alarmed
his companion:</p>

<p class="indent">"You and I have got to have a talk. Plain
talk."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s anxiety was evidenced in the tone of
his voice as he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, old son. Cackle for hours if
you like. But I wish to goodness you&#39;d lie
down and see the doctor first."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters disregarded this; considered it a
flippant, out-of-place remark; in inconceivably
bad taste. Moreover, he was disgusted
by Dick&#39;s evasion; by reason of it went himself
the straighter to the point:</p>

<p class="indent">"We left off on deck at where you were
talking of your girl. You said you were&mdash;were
not of the marrying kind!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
"Eh? Yes, of course I said so. It is so.
But what on earth does it matter what I
said?"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick still looked anxious. Was making
all due allowance for the fact that literary
fellows are inclined to be cranks. Yet was
doubtful whether the man with his back to
the door was not overstepping the limits of
legitimate and traditional crankiness.</p>

<p class="indent">"It matters a deal!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters uttered these words so fiercely that&mdash;in
no way relieved&mdash;Dick said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Does it? Well then, Prince, old fellow,
if you&#39;re so anxious about my future as all
that, I&#39;ll relieve your anxiety. I can truthfully
tell you that I have never set eyes on a
girl yet that I should be at all likely to
marry. Wine&#39;s been my trouble, not
women."</p>

<p class="indent">Once more the black blood surged up;
a curtain seemed to come up before Masters&#39;
eyes; a thick misty curtain blotting things
out. But he knew he must keep his temper
in hand; exhibit only calmness. He would
gain more that way: for the child&#39;s sake&mdash;for
her sake.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick." He spoke with all the earnestness
in him. "Awhile back you spoke of being
grateful to me. Said you would do anything
to&mdash;to please me."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
"So I would, old fellow; so I would. On
my soul I would! But I wish to goodness you
would lie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s hand was placed soothingly on his
companion&#39;s shoulder, as he spoke. Masters
bore it, but interrupted expression of the
wish that he would lie down; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Suppose I put you to the test? If I ask
you to marry your girl, will you do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick answered with a laugh. Despite the
anxiety of which he was so full, he could not
resist a feeling of amusement at the request;
added emphatically:</p>

<p class="indent">"I most certainly will not."</p>

<p class="indent">Up surged the blood again; anger came into
the eyes which flashed so; almost blinded their
owner. A step forward, and he seized Dick
by the shoulders; held him so firmly, as in
a vice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me." He was speaking from a
throat the dryness of which made it hoarse.
"After the way in which you have behaved
to her&mdash;tell me why you refuse to marry
her?"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick looked at his companion doubtfully;
had not a trace of anger in doing so. Felt
that in dealing with him the truth was the
only thing; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Refuse to marry her? Why, you confounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
old idiot, you! How on earth can
a fellow marry his own sister?"</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Sister!</span>"</p>

<p class="indent">Just the one word&mdash;he almost screamed it&mdash;that
was all Masters could utter. He started
away and released his hold. Fell back
against the door, in the intensity of his
astonishment, clutching wildly, unfeelingly,
at the panels for support.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s anxiety rapidly gained strength;
he became more alarmed than ever. Formed
the idea now that this was no passing
faintness, but that Masters was seriously ill.
Was even afraid to leave him standing
there against the door, for fear he should fall.
Suddenly, flinging off his coat, he cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re stronger than I am, and I guess
I&#39;ll get the worst of it, but here goes."</p>

<p class="indent">He stood threateningly in front of the
much bigger man, the light of determination
in his eyes; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you lie down on that bunk and let
me fetch you the doctor? Refuse, and as
sure as I stand here I shall try my hardest to
make you."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters pressed his hands to his aching,
throbbing forehead. His mind was whirling
so, that it was no wonder he staggered. His
brain did not seem able to hold the blend:
could not contain so much happiness and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
much condemnation of himself, for his unutterable
foolishness. True to his threat,
Dick advanced; Masters warded him off.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t, Dick! Just a moment, old
fellow.... I don&#39;t want a doctor. What
you have just said has done me more good
than a syndicate of all the doctors in the
world could effect."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed weakly, foolishly: by no means
a confidence-inspiring laugh. The mirth, if
such it could be called, and the change of tone
were even more disturbing to the listener.</p>

<p class="indent">"What have I said? Here, Prince, you
are going off your nut, old man; that&#39;s what&#39;s
the matter with you! I thought it when you
began this game, but I didn&#39;t like to say so;
I must now. Sitting in the sun so much
has given you a mild attack of sunstroke.
If you&#39;ve any feeling that you would like to
knock me about, now&#39;s your time to indulge
it; for I am going to try to make you come
away from that door."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! My dear boy! I assure you I am
all right! All I want is a talk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Talk! Great Scott! Have you done
anything else? This has been like a tabbies&#39;
tea-fight! There&#39;s been enough chatter to
keep a tree-full of monkeys going! Talk!
Christopher Columbus! It&#39;s been a perfect
Niagara of jaw!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
"There, I&#39;ll lie in my bunk if it will please
you, Dick."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s that, or sudden death from a blow of
this ought-to-be brawny arm! Money or
your life was never uttered more seriously
than I am talking. The doctor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go for the doctor, Dick, please. I
don&#39;t need him. I am all right now."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve only your word for that; I may
tell you that your face doesn&#39;t lend any
confirmation! You look as if you&#39;d lost your
seven senses and couldn&#39;t say Bo! to a
goose! Are you better?... Really? Honour
bright?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes, yes. Tell me, Dick, if she is
your sister, who is Gracie?"</p>

<p class="indent">It looked like a turning of the tables!
Was Dick&#39;s turn to start and exhibit surprise.
His was the wide-open-eyed-and-mouthed
type of astonishment; showed
plainly in his face; deception was a thing unknown
to him. A moment&#39;s wondering
silence; then he inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"Who&#39;s Gracie? How the dickens did
you know there was any Gracie? Why, she&#39;s
her kid, of course; my little niece!"</p>

<p class="indent">At that the man in the bunk laughed.
Almost his old hearty ringing laugh again.
But even yet it retained a tone of wildness;
he cried:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
"Blind! Blind! Blind! What a crass
idiot; what a senseless fool I have been!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick scratched his head; these sudden
changes of mood were too much for him;
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you certainly <i>are</i> behaving in first-prize-gold-medal
idiotic fashion! But the
puzzle to me is, how the deuce did you
know anything about little Gracie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Know about her? I actually know her!
Good heavens! How clear it all seems
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does it? That&#39;s all right! I may be
permitted to remark that our ideas on
opaqueness would be likely to differ!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It was she&mdash;oh, Dick, Dick, Dick!
Don&#39;t you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How can I help doing so&mdash;when you are
so lucid! You brainless old firework, you;
let off some more crackers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick! It was she, she who christened
me Prince!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What! Why, you said it was the girl
to whom you had spoken about marriage!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite right."</p>

<p class="indent">The idea returned to Dick that there must
be something wrong, very wrong&mdash;as he put
it&mdash;in Masters&#39; upper storey. Marriage!
With Gracie! It was simply too absurd for
words; he said:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
"You jibbering old idiot, you, what do you
mean? Gracie isn&#39;t five years old!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know! I know! I know! And yet a
month ago at Wivernsea I promised her,
if when she grew up she wanted to marry me&mdash;which
she won&#39;t&mdash;that I would."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wivernsea! Why, you know my sister!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters started up. Gripped the boy by
both shoulders and shook him. Happiness
struggled with the tears in his eyes as he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick, just a wee while ago&mdash;forgive me
for it, laddie&mdash;I hated you! Now I love you!
I love you! I love you! You&#39;ve told me
just the best news I&#39;ve heard for years."</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s all right, old man."</p>

<p class="indent">He shook himself free, and ruefully rubbing
his shoulders, continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"What that news may be I don&#39;t know;
it&#39;s beyond my intellect&#39;s horizon. However,
as it pleases you it&#39;s sufficient&mdash;so long as
it doesn&#39;t hurt me. Don&#39;t make me black and
blue in the exuberance of your affection.
As the poet hath it: It&#39;s all very well to
dissemble your love, but why do you kick
me downstairs?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m sorry, Dick&mdash;really sorry. Did I
hurt you? I&#39;m so full of happiness that I
could kick myself for having been such a
fool all this horrible long time."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
"You speak in the past tense. Seems to
me the foolishness is only just coming to a
head!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Stop your chaff, there&#39;s a good fellow.
You can use that later on. Just now it&#39;s
almost life and death with me. What&#39;s
your sister&#39;s full name, Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Full name? Mabel Seton-Carr, of
course!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course! Of course! Of course! Didn&#39;t
Gracie write it in full in my book?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll be hanged if I know! I shouldn&#39;t
think it would add to the book&#39;s sale if she
did&mdash;with my remembrance of her pothooks
and hangers. You don&#39;t live at Wivernsea,
do you? I never heard that there was a
lunatic asylum there!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lived there for years!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Then perhaps you knew Mabel&#39;s
husband, Seton-Carr, when he was alive?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When&mdash;he&mdash;was&mdash;alive?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Of course! You blithering old
idiot, you; what are you looking at me like
that for? You don&#39;t think that I am such
an utter egregious ass as to suggest that
you have known him since his death, do
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How long, Dick&mdash;how long&mdash;how long
has he been dead?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nine&mdash;ten months now. Between ourselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
there was not much to regret when he
added his signature to the big death-roll.
Though it&#39;s not customary to speak truth of
a man who can&#39;t speak for himself, is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Blind! Blind! Blind! She&#39;s a widow!
Of course! What a fool&mdash;what a fool I have
been!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear, hear&mdash;large-sized kind!"</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>EJECTED FROM THE CABIN</h3>

<p class="indent">Masters remained buried in thought
for a few moments. The sudden
opening of his eyes and the refreshing news
were almost overpowering him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he looked up at his companion,
who was watching him closely; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You can&#39;t think, Dick, my dear boy, what
a big fool I have been making of myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;I can&#39;t. If it was any foolishness
bigger than your present size, it must have
been simply colossal!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You told your sister of me in your letter.
Did you mention me as Prince Charlie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course!"</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;ll know! She&#39;ll guess! I am glad.
Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!"</p>

<p class="indent">He seized and wrung the hand of the
amazed Dick, utterly ignoring his feelings.
Only felt that he must do something to
relieve his own. He retained just sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
self-control to keep himself from indulging
in a wild dance of jubilation.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick, affecting to nurse crushed fingers,
made an effort to get to the bottom of things.
Usually he accepted circumstances without
inquiry as to their source; but suspicion
was roused in him now. It was suspicion
of a kind that he wanted to make into certainty;
he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"A few minutes ago you expressed regret
that I had mentioned you at all in the letter."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know! But a few minutes ago things
were all gloomy and black and ugly! Now
they are all bright, rose-coloured and lovely.
The sun has risen! The pulse of day is
beginning to beat!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, old chap&mdash;how much a thousand
words do you get for that kind of thing?
You roll it off as naturally as water rolls off
a duck&#39;s back."</p>

<p class="indent">"When do we reach London, Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Reach London? Are you mad? Why,
we haven&#39;t turned round on our homeward
journey yet!"</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s some sort of overland route, isn&#39;t
there? We can get back quicker?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quicker? You are mad! It was only
this very morning that you were expressing
regret that the time of the trip wasn&#39;t going
to be double the length!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
"This morning was then! Now is now!
Oh, Dick, you stony-hearted, wicked villain
you!" He sprang laughingly over to the
boy as he spoke. "Why didn&#39;t you say
before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep off!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick, dodging, picked up the first thing
his hands rested on and assumed a burlesque
attitude of threat as he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Assault me again with one of your
hundred-ton affectionate squeezes, and I&#39;ll
blow your brains out with this telescope.
Throw up your hands!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I surrender!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters laughingly fell in with the other&#39;s
burlesque melodramatic humour; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am a bear, but a tamed one. I haven&#39;t
a squeeze left in me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps your Royal Highness is saving
them up," suggested Dick, his eyes twinkling
as he spoke. "I begin to have a grave suspicion&mdash;garnered
from some of your rambling
ravings&mdash;that you have designs on my sister!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have, Dick, I have!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Open confession is good for the soul!
But you don&#39;t fool me. I should be false
to every sense of brotherly duty if I failed
to warn her against your embraces. I shall
bear the marks of one of them&mdash;on my
shoulder&mdash;to the grave."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
"Dear old Dick!" Masters started forward
impulsively: "I am ever so sorry
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep off! Keep off! If you don&#39;t I&#39;ll
scream for help!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters&#39; thoughts went off at a tangent.
Love is a leveller. Even authors, under the
influence of that other circumstance to which
all flesh is heir, are not superior to a passion
for the conjunction of octavo sheets and
pens. It found expression in Masters&#39; exclamation:</p>

<p class="indent">"The letters!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick, inexperienced in such matters, failed
to understand. His denseness was irritating.
He was aware of that, but only with intent
to provoke, ejaculated:</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The letters! Don&#39;t you understand?
We haven&#39;t touched port yet&mdash;not near it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Four hours off yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I shall have time to write to your
sister myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"What&mdash;in four hours? Bold adventurer!
If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try,
try, try, again. Your bravery unmans me!
Excuse these tears!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Clear out of this cabin, Dick, and leave
me to myself. I want to write."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! For four hours? I&#39;ll be hanged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
if you do! Four hours of letter from a man
in your condition would prove deadly to the
woman receiving it. I won&#39;t be party to such
inhumanity."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go out?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I won&#39;t! I paid the ship people for
half this cabin, and I&#39;m going to assert my
rights.... Keep off, Prince Charlie. If you
put a finger on me I&#39;ll have you tried by
court-martial, and sentenced to walk the
plank!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you leave peaceably then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I won&#39;t; keep off!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was thoroughly enjoying the situation
now; his face was one huge beaming grin as
he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Besides, I am going to write a letter
myself. To my sister, warning her against
the introduction of a lunatic into the family.
She has been good to me, and I shall take
this opportunity of making some return for
it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You wrote your letter to her this morning
on deck with the stub of a pencil. Go and
write the other the same way."</p>

<p class="indent">"Shan&#39;t! Can&#39;t: want ink. Couldn&#39;t
describe your vile character in pencil; such
labour necessitates ink: black ink."</p>

<p class="indent">"Out you go!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep off!... If you evict me from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
my cabin&mdash;I believe you are a woild Oirish
landlord in disguise, you spalpeen&mdash;I&#39;ll sue
you for damages, and have you hanged at
the yard arm."</p>

<p class="indent">"Out you go!"</p>

<p class="indent">That time the boy&#39;s dodging ended in
failure; his laughter rather handicapped
him. The other, laughing triumphantly,
caught, struggled with and pushed him out
of the cabin. Clapping the door to, bolted
it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Masters sought again his berth,
intending to indulge in a little castle-building:
aerial kind. Dick&#39;s tattooing on the door-panels
with his fists eliciting no reply, he bent
and shouted through the keyhole:</p>

<p class="indent">"You bushranging brigand! You buccaneering
bandit! You blood-thirsty old
skull-and-cross-bones, you! I&#39;ve just remembered
that this is piracy! Piracy on the high
seas! I&#39;m going straight to the Captain to
get the handcuffs polished up. I&#39;ll make it
my business to see you go back to England
in irons. Put that in your pipe and smoke
it."</p>

<p class="indent">With that he retired&mdash;to the accompaniment
of a shrilly whistled Rule Britannia
and a tramp as of soldiers. Masters was left
the opportunity of writing his love-letter.</p>

<p class="indent">He came out of the land of dreams. Sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
down at the table, and drew paper and pen
towards him, implements of his trade. Spent
time in looking at the paper, pen in hand, but
no words were formed.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed strange that a man who for
many years had gained a living by dexterous
juggling with words should be unable to
shape them now. But they would not come,
to his satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">"What can I say on paper," he thought,
"which will exhibit my awakened conscience?
Will be sufficiently contrite and penitent to
appeal to her? Nothing! Half the meaning
of a letter lies in the reading of it. She would
be justified, fully justified, from her present
point of view, if she were to throw it into the
fire without reading it at all."</p>

<p class="indent">A look of gloom settled on his countenance;
he asked himself:</p>

<p class="indent">"What right have I to write to her at all?&mdash;after
the way in which I insulted her? To
apologise on paper is the act of a coward.
I must go to her, and hear her contempt of
me. I deserve it."</p>

<p class="indent">He did not write his letter after all.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>AS SOBER AS A JUDGE</h3>

<p class="indent">That determination of his, to wait, was
a hard thing for Masters to adhere to.
He knew it was a wholesome resolve; at
the same time the pill was very bitter:
uncoated kind.</p>

<p class="indent">It is so much easier to do things on the
spur of the moment; courage is an unbidden
lieutenant then. Later on the aid must
consciously be gathered together.</p>

<p class="indent">Curiously enough, Masters experienced
pleasure in making the way hard for himself;
there was no attempt to boil the peas before
putting them in his shoe. It seemed more
just to her whom he had wronged, this
penance: a flagellation of his soul, as it
were.</p>

<p class="indent">"She must witness my utter, abject
humility," he reflected. "Must hear my
prayer for forgiveness of my doubt of her.
My sorrow must be seen; I can&#39;t paint it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
pen and ink. Whatever I wrote&mdash;oh, the
voice is mightier than the pen!&mdash;she might
refuse to forgive me. Besides, if she is forewarned,
knows I intend seeking her, she may
even refuse to see me. I won&#39;t give her the
chance; I won&#39;t write at all."</p>

<p class="indent">That was his decision; the result of half-an-hour&#39;s
close thought and the consumption
of three pipes of tobacco. Then he sought
his companion on deck. Braced himself up
for the interview, rightly guessing the manner
in which he would be assailed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo!" Dick grinned. "What have
you come up on deck for&mdash;inspiration?
Think to infuse a sea-kissed salty air in your
correspondence? I wouldn&#39;t lose any of
that four hours if I were you. How many
quires of my superfine cream-laid vellum
note paper have you consumed so far? I
know you haven&#39;t got any of your own."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a sheet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have changed my mind."</p>

<p class="indent">"I deny the possibility of that! You
haven&#39;t a mind to change!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am not going to write a letter at all."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! After all this fuss too! Well,
I am&mdash;there! After those absolutely brutal
and unprovoked assaults on me too! Truly
has the mountain laboured!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
"What I have to say shall be uttered
orally."</p>

<p class="indent">"I doubt that! If my sister takes the
advice I have given her in this letter, you&#39;ll
never have a chance of getting within earshot.
I have told her that you are the most
violent, headstrong, ferocious, wrathful
savage I ever met; that you are coming
home. I have advised her to flee from the
wrath to come."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are incorrigible, Dick."</p>

<p class="indent">"I like that! For pure and adulterated
cheek, that annexes Huntley &amp; Palmers&#39;
entire factory! I am viciously assaulted by
a rabid lunatic. I am deprived of the use
of ink and paper purchased with my own
hard coin. I am thrown out of my cabin.
And the man guilty of these foul crimes
coolly stands in front of me with a pipe and
a jeering remark in his mouth. Incorrigible!"</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear old Dick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters commenced a speech so; putting
his hand on the boy&#39;s shoulder affectionately.
He was interrupted by the cry of:</p>

<p class="indent">"Hands off!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick assumed an appearance of abject fear,
shivering like a calves-foot jelly. It was
belied by the grin he could not keep off his
face as he continued:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
"No more of your affection! I want to
walk ashore. I don&#39;t want to be carried
on a stretcher, maimed for life."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was in earnest: deadly earnest.
He wished he could get his companion to
veer round from his frivolous mood. There
was a slight frown on his face, as he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you be serious, Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">The boy was not insensible to the intonation
of the words. Looked up, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to talk to you about your sister."</p>

<p class="indent">The opportunity was too good to be missed;
appealed irresistibly to the humorous side
of the listener; frivolity gained the day.
Dick&#39;s nature was such that happiness ever
wanted to bubble up, and it was so long since
he had felt inclined to give it a show. He
emitted a groan; leaned back in the deck
chair and thrust his hands into his pockets.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought that," he said. "I guessed it!
Existence aboard this lugger&#39;s going to be
made a curse to me! I am going to have
her drummed into my ears all the rest of the
voyage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Understand, Prince Charleigh, that I
know her. Have known her for nearly one-and-twenty
years. By your own showing,
you have known her little more than a month.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
... Very well, two months then. It&#39;s out
of your power to present her in any light in
which I haven&#39;t seen her. I know the colour
of her eyes, hair and teeth; the tilt of her
nose and the length of it; how she looks
when she&#39;s doing this, and how she looks
when she&#39;s doing that. You understand?
I&#39;m not going to be bored all day long with
your two-months old description of her."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters could not help laughing. Concluded
that it would be best to let the boy
run on. Necessarily he must reach the end
of his tether, and his own turn would come
then, when, in the natural course of things,
the other&#39;s exuberance had subsided.</p>

<p class="indent">"You may laugh! You&#39;re infected. The
disease is coursing through your veins. But
you&#39;re not going to make a victim of me.
When you feel it coming on, you just go to
the bows&mdash;there&#39;s never any one there&mdash;and
rhapsodize to the ship&#39;s figurehead. Spare
me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">Masters spoke quite patiently, smiling the
while. He was giving the other his head; it
was his best, his only, plan.</p>

<p class="indent">"Grin on, you old lunatic! But I warn
you, if you seek to make my life a misery by
pouring lover-like descriptions of my sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
into my unwilling ear, I&#39;ll abandon myself to
the mercy of the ocean, and sneak off alone
in the Captain&#39;s gig."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I do want to talk to you about your
sister."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick groaned again. He was in great good
humour; his feet were beating a lively tattoo;
Masters continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"But I don&#39;t propose now, or hereafter, to
say one word about her appearance, manner
or ways."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, thanks, kind sir. For this relief
much thanks. Excuse this emotion; they
are tears of relief."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a limit; Masters was reaching
it. Was forced into saying, half seriously,
half jokingly:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are the most unsympathetic, hard-hearted
brute that ever existed."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick grinned. It was exactly what he
wanted to hear; took the utterance as the
greatest possible compliment. He was succeeding
admirably; restraining his delight,
he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Your flattery is too subtle. You wrap
it up too much: like an American caramel.
Please remember that my perception is not
as delicate as yours."</p>

<p class="indent">"There is one thing I wanted to ask you,
but whilst you are in this mood, I won&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
He turned to walk away. Dick realized
the possibility of carrying a joke too far;
in a minute was all repentance. He would
not have wounded his friend&#39;s feelings for
worlds; called out:</p>

<p class="indent">"Come back.... Orate. I&#39;ll be as sober
as a judge."</p>

<p class="indent">He fully meant that.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE FINANCIAL LOADSTONE</h3>

<p class="indent">Masters walked back to where Dick
was sitting; stood facing the boy
again. It was plain that he was really
worried; evidently had something on his
mind. Dick paid as much quiet attention as
it was possible for him to bestow as the
author spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">"You will oblige me very much by listening.
This business reminds me of the boys
and the frog, and I am not finding the rôle
of frog a pleasant one to fill. If you will drop
stone throwing and let me croak, I shall take
it as a particular favour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Croak on."</p>

<p class="indent">"When I told you that I had lived at
Wivernsea for years, I should have said only
a month in each year. I go down there each
October."</p>

<p class="indent">"This is of absorbing interest!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s intentions were good, but his high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
spirits got the better of him. The look on
his companion&#39;s face induced him to settle
for another effort of solemnity.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was necessary for me to tell you that;
by way of explanation of how little I know of
Ivy Cottage!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Croak on."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was leaning against the handrail,
his fingers handling the ropes which supported
the lifeboat. He put both arms through
and, resting so, spoke on:</p>

<p class="indent">"People in Wivernsea&mdash;who don&#39;t know
your sister&mdash;don&#39;t speak well of the place,
Dick."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean&mdash;haunted?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. Worse than that."</p>

<p class="indent">The gravity in the speaker&#39;s manner was
not without its effect on the boy. A spasm
of pain shot across his face; he sat up soberly
enough now. The feet ceased their drumming;
the hands came out of his pockets;
the air of nonchalance fell from him like a
mask.</p>

<p class="indent">"Worse? What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That is what I am anxious to have
explained. In a sense, it is no business of
mine, but I want it cleared up for your
sister&#39;s sake; and I think you ought to know."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"This tittle-tattle I am referring to. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
goes to the length of saying that people living
at Ivy Cottage go under false names. That
not long since, the sheriff was in possession
under a warrant of execution and the furniture
was seized. Of course, I know they are
all lies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re wrong, Prince. There is a basis
of truth in it."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters started in surprise. Dick&#39;s head
was bent, to hide the flush of shame on his
face. He spoke in a troubled voice; then
suddenly lifted his head; meant to speak
honestly, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am the foundation of that; the miserable
cause of that rumour."</p>

<p class="indent">"You!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. You can&#39;t help despising my
meanness when I have told you, even if you
don&#39;t already. It is due to you that I should
explain how it came about. I have had
drinking bouts similar to the last one you
helped me out of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>The</i> last one."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please God&mdash;yes; the last one. At the
commencement of one of them, about six
months ago, I fell an easy victim to some
card-sharpers; I was a stranger within their
gates and they took me in&mdash;literally. I had
no more idea what I was playing than I had
of the character of the players. A thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
pounds was the amount they said I had lost,
and I was too far gone to deny it. Of course
I had not that money on me. I was made to
sign a cheque they drew on my bankers on a
half-sheet of note paper with a penny stamp
stuck on it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was reaching the shaky stage then,
Prince, when the hands need a ton-weight
pressure to prevent their acting like aspen
leaves. The bank refused payment on the
ground of &#39;difference of signature.&#39; The
card-sharping people consulted the six-and-eightpenny
fraternity and issued a writ for
that thousand pounds. Served it on me
whilst I was lying in bed in a state of mental
insensibility."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it possible? I wonder the process-server
was allowed to enter your room."</p>

<p class="indent">"He was the kind that could not be kept
out. They had a wily little lawyer acting
for them&mdash;I found this all out afterwards,
of course. He found out the name of the
medical man attending me and presented
himself as the doctor&#39;s assistant; so served
me."</p>

<p class="indent">"What a beastly trick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Success attended its performance, though.
The game was in their own hands, and they
were playing it by the end-justifying-the-means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
rule. Eight days after service judgment
was signed and an execution was put
in at my sister&#39;s house at Wivernsea."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why on earth there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Part of the game they were playing.
They had made inquiries, and found that I
was living in London at the time in a furnished
flat. I suppose they relied on my sister
paying the execution out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Which she did?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She flew up to London, and consulted
our family lawyer. He looked into the thing
at the Law Courts; read the affidavit of
service and things of that sort; saw that
the whole matter was in order. They came
on to see me, but I was in the snakes-on-the-wall
stage at the time; didn&#39;t know them
from Adam and Eve. The family lawyer&mdash;one
of the best, but rather inclined to look on
the breath of scandal as a fatal thing&mdash;advised
a settlement. Said that, even if she turned
the execution out, they might proceed against
me in bankruptcy. Pointed out that expenses
were piling up, and&mdash;well, Sis paid the
sheriff."</p>

<p class="indent">"How ghastly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I used a stronger word. My adjectives
were like fireworks, then I came round and
learnt what had been done: but it was too
late. All I could do was to give Sis a cheque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
for what was paid, and ask her to forgive
me; which, dearest of dear souls, she has
done a dozen times in my miserable life."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick looked the picture of dejection by
the time he had finished. Masters was not,
however, observing him: was following out
his own train of thought.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course. That explains. News of a
thing like that, and in another name too,
would speedily spread over a small place like
Wivernsea."</p>

<p class="indent">"As easily as jam is spread on a piece of
bread. I never thought of that, though.
What a beast&mdash;what a perfect beast I have
been!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was of an excitable temperament:
the alcohol in his thermometer&mdash;his spirits&mdash;was
ever at the fever-heat of exuberance or
deep down at the zero of dejection. But
little was needed to carry him to either
extreme: therein lay his danger. Masters
knew it; yet he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"If I had only known all this a few
weeks ago, I should not be on this boat
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am glad you lacked the knowledge, then,
Prince. For if you hadn&#39;t come aboard when
you did, I shouldn&#39;t be here either."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters regretted his reproachful speech
the moment it was uttered. Instantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
changed its tone; put up a warning finger
as he cried threateningly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know it, dear old chap; I know what my
intent was. But don&#39;t let&#39;s talk about it now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Or ever again."</p>

<p class="indent">The cloud cleared from the lad&#39;s face; he
responded heartily:</p>

<p class="indent">"Right!"</p>

<p class="indent">At the moment the gong sounded in the
engine-room. An air of bustle pervaded the
ship. They looked to discover the cause.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo! Why, look here! Here we are
at Madeira."</p>

<p class="indent">They were. So absorbed had they been
in conversation as not to notice how near
they were to land. The usual excitement
of a stoppage now occupied their attention.</p>

<p class="indent">The vessel was to stay at Madeira for a
time. Stores had to be taken in and the
passengers allowed a chance of seeing the
place before the vessel was turned for her
homeward voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters and Dick spent their whole time
on shore; always in each other&#39;s company.
The author explained that he liked sympathy
in his admiration for the lions of the port.
The one made many sketches and the other
many mental notes.</p>

<p class="indent">They were quite good friends again.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND</h3>

<p class="indent">Two days after; <i>La Mascotte</i> steamed
away from Madeira. The list of the
ship&#39;s passengers had been added to. Two
new persons were aboard, returning to
England.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters and Dick were seated on deck in
their usual places. The one writing, the
other sketching; suddenly a voice behind
them said:</p>

<p class="indent">"If it were needed, here is more evidence
of the smallness of the world."</p>

<p class="indent">The voice had that settled Society drawl
about it. Particularly unwelcome hearing
away from its proper setting: the surroundings
in which it is usually to be heard. In
its own sphere it is bad enough; is positively
jarring in the unconventional atmosphere of
aboard-ship life.</p>

<p class="indent">At any rate, Dick found it so, if judgment
might be framed from his expression. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
looked the reverse of pleased, but subdued
the feeling as he turned round and spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo! I didn&#39;t see you come aboard.
How do you do, old fellow? How do you
do, Miss Chantrelle?... Let me introduce
Mr. Masters to you." He knew his friend&#39;s
real name now, and was rather proud of it.
"Mr. William Masters.... Yes, the novelist&mdash;Miss
Chantrelle... Her brother, Percy
Chantrelle."</p>

<p class="indent">They formed, more or less, a quartette on
the voyage home. Dick saw he was in for
it and could not help himself&mdash;easy-going
Dick! Occasionally they paired off: Miss
Chantrelle and Dick and the two men.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters prided himself on possession of
an ability to read faces; he had no liking
for the two new ones which had come aboard
at Madeira. Miss Chantrelle&#39;s more especially
repelled him. Not because he preferred
her brother; rather that he set up a higher
standard as necessary for women than men.</p>

<p class="indent">Human nature was a power Masters ever
recognized. He could forgive a man being
hard, calculating and selfish, but not a woman;
in Miss Chantrelle&#39;s face he read all those
attributes. Still, they were Dick&#39;s friends,
more or less; so, in a measure, they became
his.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Chantrelle was equally quick in facial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
perusal; speedily read distrust in Masters&#39;.
She had not lived in the world without
acquiring its knowledge; was wise enough
to appreciate the power in others she possessed
herself. She was a distinctly clever, shrewd,
woman of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing would have arisen from all this,
but for the rattling of Master Dick&#39;s tongue.
He told of Prince Charlie&#39;s matrimonial
intent: the possibility of friend merging into
brother-in-law. At heart he was so proud
of this possibility that he would have liked
to proclaim it from the house-tops&mdash;masthead
would perhaps have been a more suitable
word.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Chantrelle listened with interest;
scarcely sympathetic interest, but the distinction
was not obvious. It was unobserved
by Dick, and he felt himself encouraged to
expound the subject he had so much at
heart. Was led on to so doing by skilfully-put
questions such as only a woman would
know how to frame.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Chantrelle was greatly displeased;
all her sympathy was assumed. The Chantrelles
were poor. Both brother and sister
were well-favoured; each looked to marriage
as a little boat in which the storm of life might
be weathered.</p>

<p class="indent">They inclined to the belief that Percy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
was a favourite with Mrs. Seton-Carr. Now
that she was a widow there was hope, a very
strong hope too, in their hearts that she might
be induced to change her name to that of
Chantrelle.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, they were coming to
England for the very purpose of trying to
induce her to do so; the Seton-Carr bank
balance serving as the lodestone.</p>

<p class="indent">They had imagined her left fairly well-to-do,
but when they saw in the newspapers
the amount her husband&#39;s estate was sworn
under, their breaths were taken away! They
promptly packed and set out for England,
home and beauty&mdash;not forgetting the aforesaid
credit balance.</p>

<p class="indent">They were greatly disturbed by what they
heard on the boat: when Dick told of the
position Masters was hoping to fill. The
disturbance rapidly shaped into indignation:
they looked on it as an endeavour to take the
bread from out their mouths. The pleasant
voyage they had looked forward to was not
without its unpleasant moments.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind, Percy." The sister speaking
to her brother one day. "Given a clear
field, you will go in and win yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"The clearness of the field is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Leave that to me; I&#39;ll make it my
business to see that you have a clear field."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
The brother shook his head as he responded
gloomily:</p>

<p class="indent">"Easier said than done, I fancy, Sis. I&#39;m
not overbrimming with hope."</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no need for despondency. We
will arrange to go to Wivernsea right off.
That young fool Dick is finger-twistable: I
can make him do anything."</p>

<p class="indent">The brother needed more than mere words
to convince him; observed sneeringly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Except propose marriage to you!"</p>

<p class="indent">An ugly light came into her eyes. His
shaft had gone in up to the feather; she spoke
bitterly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. He is not of the impressionable
kind. I don&#39;t suppose any woman will ever
get him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Odds on that, Amy, if you fail to bring
him up to the scratch."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I can make him arrange for us
to visit there. His sister thinks everything
of him.... Masters won&#39;t go
there."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be so sure of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am. He is one of those thin-skinned,
sensitive sort of beasts. There has been
some misunderstanding&mdash;probably of his own
creation&mdash;which he counts on being able to
wipe away. But he has never stayed there;
we have. He goes year after year to rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
in the place; he&#39;ll put up at the same rooms
again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Think so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Am certain of it. I can read the man as
easily&mdash;well, as easily as his books are read."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he&#39;s read. A popular writer like
that must be earning pots of money in
royalties. Might be worth setting your cap
at, Amy."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his sister critically. She was
a handsome girl. The face a trifle hard,
perhaps, but not every man goes in for
melting beauty; some look for character&mdash;so
thought her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Bitter laughter shaped on her lips at her
brother&#39;s suggestion; a woman ever takes
defeat badly; she replied:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am not his sort; I am not the kind of
woman he writes about! He can dissect me,
probably has done so, as easily as you can
carve a pigeon. Besides, he&#39;s dead gone on
Mabel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Curse him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"By all means. But whatever you do,
don&#39;t fear him. Outwardly he is as cold
as ice; inside there is a raging volcano.
Women don&#39;t hanker after that kind of love,
if there&#39;s anything more outwardly tempestuous:
like yourself. They are apt to judge
of the surface."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
"Thanks!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! It&#39;s true; we don&#39;t want to mince
words. That&#39;s where the average woman
makes a fool of herself; where your chance
comes in. Masters is worth fifty of you, but
there are no scales to balance or register
values of that kind."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks again!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, we know it, you and I. We can
speak to each other without putting foot on
the soft pedal. He has a nature which would
make him stick to a woman till, literally,
death did them part. Yours is of the type
which would prompt thoughts of a separation
the moment the woman&#39;s bank balance ran
out."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He could not resist the sneer; she had
fingered a sore place. But he did not hurt
her this time; she owned up at once:</p>

<p class="indent">"Cast in the same mould! I did not
mean blame to you. My own glass-house
prevents stone-throwing. I was merely stating
facts; I would not have them otherwise.
Men like Masters are profitless in this world.
When virtue is its own reward, the reward
is usually too small to be seen with the naked
eye. I have a distinct preference for qualifications
which are otherwise."</p>

<p class="indent">Percy smiled. Was full of admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
points for his sister. She was the stronger
of the two: he ever recognized that; she
continued bitterly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Virtue is all very well for woman: it may
serve her purpose. For a man it is a useless
luxury."</p>

<p class="indent">His own non-possession of it made him
smile again; she went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"As you don&#39;t seem inclined to take the
initiative I shall do so myself. Before we
reach Wivernsea, Mabel will have received
a letter from me. I am going to write it
ready to post at the first port we touch. It
will go by the overland route."</p>

<p class="indent">It did.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>ACHING HEARTS AND LAUGHING FACES</h3>

<p class="indent">The composition of the letter to Wivernsea
needed all the powers Miss Chantrelle
could bring to bear upon it. They were
in no way of a mean order.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not, however, grudge time or
labour; the expenditure was in a good cause:
Percy had been on the matrimonial stocks
too long; his was the kind of beauty which
age withered rather than ripened.</p>

<p class="indent">A little sigh of content escaped her when,
at last, she had finished writing. Leaning
back in her chair, the end of the penholder
between her lips, she read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">My Dearest Mab</span>,&mdash;<i>Isn&#39;t</i> it a tiny little
world? Just fancy&mdash;my brother and I are
coming back to England on the same boat
your brother is travelling by! Dear old
Dick! He looks so strong and well; better
I think than I have <i>ever</i> seen him look. With
him is Mr. Masters&mdash;oh, of course, I ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
congratulate you, oughtn&#39;t I?&mdash;but I will
leave that till I see you. It is a good job
you are not of a jealous disposition, Mab, or
I am afraid there would be a rough time ahead
for you: Mr. Masters is such a <i>dreadful</i> flirt!
He has been most popular with all the ladies
on board, and made <i>violent</i> love to me within
twenty-four hours of meeting me! He did
not succeed in <i>my</i> case, though (not because
of you, my darling Mab, because I had not
heard of your engagement to him then) but I
do not like a man who makes love to every
woman he meets; whom you run across in
odd parts of the boat engrossed in conversation
with some pretty girl, generally <i>a different
one each time</i>. But there, I must not say
anything against him, or you will never forgive
me. Besides, if you don&#39;t mind it, what
does it matter? Of course, there&#39;s no real
harm in what he does&mdash;don&#39;t think I want to
insinuate that, it is the last thing I mean&mdash;as
the girls must know he is only flirting;
perhaps his heart is with you all the time.
How beautiful it must be to have such faith
as yours&mdash;I am afraid I&#39;m not gifted that
way. You must be <i>very</i> fond of him if all he
says is true: that you dote on the ground
he walks on, etc., etc., etc. Asked if the
marriage day had been fixed, he replied that
that only rested with himself! Fancy that;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
<i>Aren&#39;t</i> the men growing dreadfully cheeky?
Your brother has asked us to come down to
Wivernsea for Christmas. I <i>never</i> saw a man
grow so awfully white as Percy did when he
heard of your forthcoming marriage to Mr.
Masters. Till then I had had no idea that
he&mdash;but there, that would be telling tales out
of school. We are coming to spend Christmas,
<i>unless</i>, dear Mabel, you would rather we
did not. If for that or <i>any reason</i> you would
rather we did not come just now, <i>wire</i> to us,
care of Charing Cross cloak room, when you
get this. <i>We shall quite understand</i> that it is
not convenient just now. You know what
a dear, impulsive boy Dick is; he <i>absolutely
insists</i> on our coming; says you will be <i>really</i>
pleased to see us. I do hope so, darling. I
have a recollection of many, <i>many</i> happy
days spent with you.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With <i>all</i> my love,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Believe me, <i>dearest</i> Mabel,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your <i>ever true</i> friend,</span><br />
<span class="i4"><span class="smcap">Amy</span>.</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">As she folded the letter and directed its
envelope she muttered:</p>

<p class="indent">"I think this puts a spoke in Prince
Charlie&#39;s wheel! If I know anything of
Mabel&#39;s pride, this won&#39;t ensure open arms
and the warmest of welcomes for him."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
She hesitated a moment, then laughed;
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no scrap of fear of my letter ever
being produced. Her pride would not allow
her to do that, and she overruns with it."</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Chantrelle was a clever woman; that
fact has been recorded. In addition to
knowing what to say and how to say it, she
correctly foresaw just the effect it would
produce. Her study of womankind was a
very close one.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter sent to Wivernsea carried all its
intended evil. The descent of a bombshell
could not have had a more disturbing effect.
After perusal of it, Mrs. Seton-Carr was simply
furious. Amy had not relied on the widow&#39;s
pride in vain. Moreover, her belief in the
proverb was justified: throw enough mud,
some of it sticks.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter was read over and over again.
Each time an effort was made to disbelieve
its contents, each time the bad impression
became deeper: that there is no smoke
without fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Laughter would have resulted at the impertinence
of Masters&#39; conduct, as detailed
in the letter, if she had not cared for the
man. That was the weak point.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a day passed without her thoughts
being full of him. The letter came as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
blow; a blow of the severely hurting sort.
Wounded pride is hard of healing: there is
generally some poison in the wound; it is
apt to spread too, and endanger the hurt.</p>

<p class="indent">By the same mail which brought the
Chantrelle episode she received a letter from
her brother Dick. It told her that he was
coming down to Wivernsea to spend his
Christmas; that Prince Charlie was coming
too.</p>

<p class="indent">Apart from the pleasure of receiving a
letter from him written with an unshaking
hand and the natural joy she felt at his buoyant
style of writing, what he said was a big
annoyance to her.</p>

<p class="indent">His letter exuded praise of Masters in every
sentence. It was easy to read between the
lines that he looked upon himself as that
gentleman&#39;s future brother-in-law. This to
Mrs. Seton-Carr could only fit as a
confirmation of her friend Amy&#39;s letter.</p>

<p class="indent">Pride and a readily aroused temper usually
battle together with conspicuous success.
Mabel worked herself up to such a pitch of
excitement that she positively cried. To
think that this man&mdash;she knew in her heart
of hearts that she loved him&mdash;should have
the effrontery to talk of her so!</p>

<p class="indent">Was it to be nothing but insult from him?
Could she not&mdash;was it not possible to&mdash;pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
him back somehow? What had she done
that he should single her out for annoyance?
Whatever it might be, when was she to feel
herself free from his cowardly attacks?</p>

<p class="indent">If only he were open about the matter;
but he was not. Then came remembrance
of the time of Gracie&#39;s convalescence; how
he had ever treated her with uniform
courtesy. She remembered, and sighed. The
crown of sorrow is the remembrance of happier
days.</p>

<p class="indent">The inaudible feet of Time continued their
never-ending progress. It was not a period
in which Mrs. Seton-Carr was at ease; the
amount of patience in which she possessed
her soul could have been easily balanced
on a needle point.</p>

<p class="indent">The steamer bringing the quartette reached
England. The four passengers kept together;
travelled down to Wivernsea in the same
carriage. Reached it early in Christmas
week.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s reluctance to allow Masters to go to
his old lodgings was manifest. There were
many spare rooms at Ivy Cottage, he said,
so why not go there? In his opinion it was
simply idiotic to pig in at digs. But Masters
had ideas of his own; at that moment they
did not fit in with his friend&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chantrelles went on with Dick to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
Ivy Cottage. It was arranged that Masters
should turn up there in the evening in time
for dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been a trifle reluctant to accept
that invitation at Dick&#39;s hand, but did so.
He could have kicked himself, later, for doing
so. As for Dick, the nearer they drew to
the point where separation must come, the
more full of admiration and real affection he
became. He rested uneasily whenever his
friend was out of his sight.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters impatiently ticked off the hours
till the arrival of dinner-time. He wanted
so to see the woman he loved. Wanted a
quiet ten minutes, that he might pour out
his heart to her. He was willing to ask her
forgiveness on his knees&mdash;had she not knelt
to him? Had a heart-aching, a tongue-itching,
to tell her that she was the one woman
in the world for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Things are not always disposed as man
proposes; he did not tell her that. The
quiet ten minutes did not come. When he
entered Ivy Cottage before dinner it was
with a light heart, the happiest man in
Wivernsea. He left it after, with a heart
of lead, the most miserable of men.</p>

<p class="indent">Beneath the surface, the dinner party
was not a success; yet it cannot be said to
have flagged. Almost every one was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
good spirits, in too good spirits, apparently,
to trouble about the quiet man who sat next
to Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was thunderstruck at his friend&#39;s
reticence. Thought at first that he must be,
ridiculous as it seemed, suffering from shyness.
Mrs. Seton-Carr thought she was getting
a little of her own back! She got more;
more than all.</p>

<p class="indent">Common decency prevented her cutting
Masters dead. But, as nearly as was consistent
with common politeness, that was
what happened. As fuel to fire was the open
and violent flirtation of the hostess with
Percy Chantrelle.</p>

<p class="indent">Exultant as she was of her success, flushed
as was her cheek with triumph&mdash;she knew
Masters was smarting&mdash;she feared that she
almost overdid it. But the pulsations of
Percy&#39;s heart were accelerated; beat fast
with hope: so did his sister&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">It was impossible to avoid seeing Mrs.
Seton-Carr&#39;s flushed excitement. Masters
noted too the soft glances she shot across
the table Percy Chantrelle&#39;s way; noticed
them with a feeling at his heart which was
more than painful.</p>

<p class="indent">The author was in possession of more than
his usual keenness. Perhaps it out-balanced
his power of cool observation. Anyway, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
saw not beneath the surface. The soundness
of his deductions suffered by reason thereof.</p>

<p class="indent">They were happy enough, the brother and
sister; the only real happiness there was
around the table. Mabel was playing a
part: playing it well; wore her mask with
success. Her laugh rang out merrily at each
of Chantrelle&#39;s jokes. But just as full as her
face and voice were of mirth, so was her heart
full of ache and pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Seton-Carr would have given worlds
just then to be able to rise from her table;
she needed so greatly to go to her room for a
good cry. But a Lucifer-like pride upheld
her. Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
weep, and you weep alone. She knew that.</p>

<p class="indent">The men did not remain long in union
after the retirement of the ladies. To two-thirds
of the trinity the cigars seemed
flavourless. As a matter of fact, their respective
elements lacked the power of combination.</p>

<p class="indent">The third factor, Chantrelle, was happy
enough; triumph made him so. But there
was no infection in his merriment. As a
smoking-room raconteur he was usually a
big success. But to-night his best stories
fizzled out to lame and impotent conclusions.</p>

<p class="indent">The laugh of approval was conspicuously
absent.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>AS FAITHFUL AS A DOG</h3>

<p class="indent">The men left the smoke-room; there
was no calumet of peace there. All
Percy&#39;s efforts to be entertaining ended in&mdash;perhaps
appropriately&mdash;smoke. They joined
the ladies, to find harmony and concord;
music was under way.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters was full of thought; deep misery
kind. Whatever charm music may have to
soothe a savage breast, it had none for him.
He was ever a failure at social functions:
was conspicuously so to-night; detested
them, in fact, with a whole-souled detestation.</p>

<p class="indent">As to Dick, the gloom which had fallen
on him during dinner seemed too thick for
penetration. Merry Dick belied his nickname;
had no more merriment in him than
has a mute at a funeral.</p>

<p class="indent">In the drawing-room Masters was as miserable
as he had been in the dining and smokerooms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Turned over photographs; sought
in vain for something to make him look less
of a fool than he felt. At last came to the
end of his endurance tether; under a plea
of some work he had to post to a publisher
by the early morning&#39;s mail, hastily excused
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a glorious night, old chap." Dick,
speaking hoarsely, and getting into his great-coat.
"I&#39;ll walk home with you. We will
smoke a cigar together."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters said good-night; shook hands.
Noticed the burning heat of Mrs. Seton-Carr&#39;s,
as for a moment her hand rested in
his&mdash;but did not accord the true reason for
it. She was even laughing with Chantrelle
at the very moment she said good-night;
was a natural actress: a woman.</p>

<p class="indent">"How quiet Mr. Masters is." The cat purring:
Amy speaking, as the door closed.
"But I suppose, socially, authors are as
dull as ditch water. Keep all their clever
thoughts for their books. It is selfish of
them in the extreme."</p>

<p class="indent">Amy laughed gaily; continued in that
strain. Laughter is the allotment of those
who win; the Chantrelles felt justified in
the belief that they were in no way losing.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Seton-Carr professed accord in the
opinion of Masters&#39; dulness; the sea voyage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
had not improved him. Society was not the
thing he shone in; in fact, she had found him
rather depressing; was glad he left so early.
Lies! Lies&mdash;each and every one of the
opinions she expressed.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men who had left the bungalow
walked along the Parade for a time without
speaking. Each was full of emotion. Dick&#39;s
found vent first; he blurted out:</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m&mdash;I&#39;m awfully sorry, old man!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a faint tinge of nervousness in
Masters&#39; responding laugh; he was not a
man to assimilate pity very well, even his
best friends&#39;. Throwing away the cigar,
which had gone out, he lighted his pipe;
the match betrayed a shaking hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks.... Cloudless night; looks
like being a fine day to-morrow, doesn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">The effort to change the subject proved
futile; Dick spoke impulsively:</p>

<p class="indent">"Hang the weather!... You don&#39;t
think I knew anything of this, dear old
chap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! No!"</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;or you know I should have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes. I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mab has always professed to positively
loathe Percy; tolerated him because she
liked his sister. He is a bit of a bounder, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
"Your sister does not seem to share in
that opinion of yours."</p>

<p class="indent">He could not quite keep the bitterness out
of the way in which he said that.</p>

<p class="indent">"No!"</p>

<p class="indent">The brother admitted it; spoke just as
bitterly. When they reached his lodgings
Masters said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Come round, will you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;you won&#39;t come on to the cottage
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no! No!"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I didn&#39;t expect you would. I had
counted on things being so different! Counted
on a merry Christmas."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick laughed as he said, thought of, a
merry Christmas: the unpleasant, ironic
laugh of a disappointed man. Just then he
was as full of disappointment as he could well
hold.</p>

<p class="indent">"I had gone in for a certain amount of
accountancy too."</p>

<p class="indent">Masters made the response with a little
catch in his voice, which the assumed laugh
could not disguise. He had stopped and was
standing with his hand on Dick&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you remember that last time I held
you like this, dear boy? I was so full of
joy then, so blinded by it, to what I was
doing, that you accused me of squeezing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
you to hurting point." A sigh punctuated
his speech. "I don&#39;t feel like hurting you
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Squeeze the life out of me, if it will be
any relief to your feelings." Dick spoke
gruffly. "It&#39;s your life. I shouldn&#39;t be
living at all if it were not for you."</p>

<p class="indent">He was a good boy was Dick, with a heart
in him; a heart in the right place. It
grieved him to see even the suspicion of a
tear in the eye of the friend he loved so
well.</p>

<p class="indent">His own brown eyes looked into the
author&#39;s with silent, dog-like fidelity and
sympathy. Masters was not insensible to it.
It was an eloquent silence; expressed far
more to him than words could have done.</p>

<p class="indent">"I made a mistake, Dick; that&#39;s all. I
suppose all of us do; the world seems so full
of them.... And let this be the last of it,
dear old man, will you? Don&#39;t recur to it
ever again; please. The sore is fresh, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
don&#39;t mind owning to you, it hurts.
Please don&#39;t let us talk about it&mdash;ever again&mdash;please."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick grasped the hand extended to him;
held it in a long, tight grip. Put his other
hand on his companion&#39;s shoulder, and was
about to speak. Then felt that speech would
be a failure; simply said gruffly:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
"I&#39;ll see you in the morning, old man;
I&#39;ll walk round. Good-night."</p>

<p class="indent">Not another word passed between them;
a tight hand-grip and they parted. Masters
to his rooms, Dick homeward bound&mdash;a
journey he made with the blood coursing
through his veins at boiling point. He had
more than a little of his sister&#39;s temper.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was simply furious at the manner in
which Mabel had treated Masters. He dared
not trust himself to more talk that night.
Just looked into the drawing-room at the
bungalow, professed weariness, said a hurried
good-night and retired to his room.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning, Gracie offered strong
evidence that she had a tongue in her head;
was full of the return of Prince Charlie. She
had heard of his arrival with delight; was
running over with anxiety to see him. Instinctively
she felt that Uncle Dick was the
ways and means. When she heard that he
was going to call on Masters that morning,
she emulated the limpet; he could not have
shaken her off had he tried.</p>

<p class="indent">"Get your things on, Puss," said Dick,
as the breakfast things were being cleared
away, "and I&#39;ll take you round to see him."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Chantrelle professed the most acute
astonishment. Not so much by what she
said, but the way she acted. Wasn&#39;t Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
Masters coming in to lunch?... Nor to
dinner? Not at all that day?... Those
carefully combed eyebrows of hers almost
disappeared under her fringe&mdash;she was so
surprised!</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie had scampered off and returned in
full war-paint: best hat, best shoes, best coat
and, crowning glory, new muff! She did hope
Prince Charlie would notice it and ask her
all about it. But if he did not, she could tell
him. That is one of the advantages of being
very young.</p>

<p class="indent">When Gracie and Dick had gone out, Miss
Chantrelle improved the opportunity with
her hostess. Nearly drove that lady to the
brink of madness by her anxiety to know if
they had quarrelled; what it meant; why
he wasn&#39;t coming, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Mabel did not know; really, the matter
was of little interest to her. His presence
made very little difference; she wondered
Amy could bother about him.</p>

<p class="indent">That was what she was able to bring herself
to say. But the effort was a big one;
she was not a conspicuous success in lies of the
top-notch kind.</p>

<p class="indent">Matters continued in this way. Things
are not always what they seem; it was by
no means a pleasant little party at Ivy
Cottage. When at home&mdash;which was a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
rare thing, for he spent most of his time at
Masters&#39; lodgings&mdash;Dick was sulky to the
extreme of sullenness.</p>

<p class="indent">Affairs wore a different complexion a little
later. When the rosy finger heralded the
dawn of the day before Christmas, it was
the precursor of brightness of another kind.
Two incidents happened which changed the
current of things.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Chantrelle had the watchful, veiled
eyes of the domestic cat. On the principle
of striking the iron whilst hot, she urged
her brother to propose marriage to their
hostess forthwith. Thought that delays were
dangerous.</p>

<p class="indent">She took him out for a walk to discuss the
pros and cons of the proposal. Was a wise
little woman, and a firm believer in the theory
that walls have ears. Knowing what she
knew, she mapped out the route her brother
was to travel in his journey to Mrs. Seton-Carr&#39;s
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is such a thing as being too
clever: so sharp that one cuts oneself. The
average brain has a direct way of working;
sees no by-paths, so wastes no time on them;
goes straight to the point.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy&#39;s cleverness led to her undoing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>A TEACUP STORM</h3>

<p class="indent">The coast being clear, Dick&#39;s storm-cloud
burst. The Chantrelles out for
their walk, he imagined them to be washing
their domestic dirty linen, he took the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">Being alone, he meant having it out, as he
termed it, with his sister. Had quite determined
on doing it very quietly and calmly.
Whistling a few bars of Rule Britannia by
way of appropriate prelude, he said suddenly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am expecting one or two important
letters, Mab. I wish directly they come you
would send them to the post, will you&mdash;re-directed
to my club?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Re-directed&mdash;to&mdash;your&mdash;club!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I have not quite made up my
mind where I shall put up, but I am bound
to go into the club each day. You won&#39;t
forget, will you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He made a pretended movement in the
direction of the door. She was on her feet
in a moment, stopping him; stood by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
side in dismay. Seized the lapels of his coat
and looked at him reproachfully, horror-stricken;
fear for him tearing at her heart-strings.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What do I me&mdash;. Surely I spoke plainly.
I just want you to re-direct&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes, yes. But you are here!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Now. But I am going up to
London by the afternoon train."</p>

<p class="indent">"To&mdash;London!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Mabel&#39;s heart sank. She read obstinacy
in that frowning face of his; knew what sort
of thing that was to fight; had had experience
of it. She played what was usually a
trump card.</p>

<p class="indent">"And at Christmas time, too! Christmas!
You will leave me here alone?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Alone? Well&mdash;I like that! You have
got your dear friends, the Chantrelles. There
isn&#39;t much of a lonely look about you when
Percy is around."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be horrid!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why? Do you claim a monopoly of the
right to be so?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were flashing now; her face had
gone crimson-coloured, and her little foot
was tapping the floor. She had emotions
which ran up her thermometer with the
rapidity of a lightning&#39;s flash. The altitude
of their tempers just then was about equally
high.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t keep calling me Dick like that,"
he said. "It&#39;s irritating."</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"With me? Nothing!"</p>

<p class="indent">"There is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, there is. Have your own
way. I know that way&mdash;you are like the
Pears&#39; Soap boy&mdash;you won&#39;t be happy till
you get it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!" She almost spat out his name
in her fierce emphasis. "You are not going&mdash;you
shall not go to town to-day!"</p>

<p class="indent">"All being well," he replied calmly&mdash;white
heat calm&mdash;"I shall catch the three-thirty-five
up."</p>

<p class="indent">She was white too, with annoyance.
Managed to choke down some of the things
she was burning to say; was alive to what
their effect would be if uttered. She knew
Dick; experience had taught her how large
was the amount of patience needed to cope
with his impetuosity. Her foot heavily on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
the pedal of her temper, she gave forth sweet
sounds:</p>

<p class="indent">"What does this mean? Tell me, Dick.
Why are you going?"</p>

<p class="indent">The voice was so very gentle that it hurt
Dick to hurt her. But he persisted&mdash;the
little wretch, to treat his best friend so!&mdash;she
deserved it. Yawning, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I feel like spending a merry Christmas.
The kind of thing that clings to
Christmas cards and Dickens was so full of,
you know. I am afraid there isn&#39;t enough
merriment to go round here; not enough
to satisfy a man with a large appetite for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Way it is dished up, I suppose: surroundings.
I don&#39;t like your friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"My friends!"</p>

<p class="indent">The foot slipped off the pedal: the note
of temper sounded as she blazed out indignantly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Who asked them here?"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick shrugged his shoulders. Otherwise
disregarded her interruption as he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;you positively insult mine."</p>

<p class="indent">"Insult!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think that&#39;s the correct word; I can&#39;t
find a more expressive one lying about."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray who are the friends of mine that
you do not like?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
"Refrain from the obvious! You haven&#39;t
fifty thousand of them staying in the house
just now!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Chantrelles, you mean. I repeat,
who invited them here? Answer me!"</p>

<p class="indent">She stamped her foot as she let loose her
shaft. It went home this time: buried its
head, rendering Dick furious. He had cursed
himself a hundred times for being the cause
of their presence. But for that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here, Mab, you and I don&#39;t want
to quarrel."</p>

<p class="indent">A quarrel just then was the thing he was
itching for; if he could have hit something
or somebody it would have been an immense
relief to his feelings; he went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have a friend; a man who saved my
life! A man who devoted himself to me;
but for whom, I should be now at the bottom
of the sea."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">She hid her face in her hands. All the
memories she had thrust aside, grateful
memories, rushed back on her. She did
not want Dick to see what she knew her
face would show: horror of her own ingratitude
to Masters. The recollection of all
he had done for her brother flooded her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it&#39;s true! I&#39;m not romancing. When
I said good-bye to you in that Lambeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
bedroom, I meant it to be a good-bye. I
went on board that boat with the full intention
of making a hole in the water."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick! Don&#39;t say it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do say it. I say it emphatically. Life
didn&#39;t seem worth the living to me. Masters
shared my cabin; nursed me; tended me;
made me see things differently. In fact,
made a man of me. When I think of him,
and all he did for me, I cry from my heart:
God bless him! God bless him!"</p>

<p class="indent">He turned his head that she might not see
the tears filling his eyes; continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"When I think of the debt I owe him, a
debt I would pay with my life cheerfully if
it would help him, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She interrupted him; was standing close
to him again, white-faced, dry-eyed, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick!" she gasped. "You don&#39;t
know how you are hurting me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And I bring him here," he spluttered,
"to your home. Because it was the only
place I could bring him to; because I thought
my sister loved me, that she would stretch out
a warm hand of welcome to the man who
saved me. What happens? What happens?
She doesn&#39;t throw the plates and dishes at
him, but, by God! I wish she had! It
would have been better than the cold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
cutting, contemptuous nature of her insults!"</p>

<p class="indent">He struggled to get free from her arms;
they had found their way round his neck,
and her head was on his bosom. But she
held him too tightly. He was unfair; she
knew it; not all the wrong was on her side.</p>

<p class="indent">"You think nothing of me, Dick!" Her
sobbing expostulation: "You ignore the
things he has done; the way he has behaved
to me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," replied Dick grimly. "Perhaps
it&#39;s just as well I do. Gracie tells me that in
the dead of night he came, and sat up, and
nursed her back to life! That&#39;s one of the
things he did for you and the child you
profess to love so much! He&#39;s good at nursing,
is Prince Charlie, poor old chap!&mdash;I have
had some. You have had some. But it
seems to have struck us in different lights;
to have inspired different feelings. Personally,
I&#39;d lay down my life for him! The
grandest fellow I ever met; God bless him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dick! Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">She covered her face with her hands; the
tears were streaming through her fingers.
He went on pitilessly; his blood was too
hot now for softness.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t see anything to be grateful
for in what he did for you. On the contrary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
his kindly affection for Gracie is a cause of
complaint! You coolly tell me I don&#39;t know
the things he has done, and how he has behaved
to you! &#39;Prince Charlie&#39;&mdash;yes.
Gracie was right in naming him so. He is a
prince; a Real Prince. The child has more
gratitude in her little finger than you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped him. Would not let him
continue. Placed a hand over his mouth as
she cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick, you are breaking my heart!"</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>RESUMPTION OF DICK&#39;S GOOD TEMPER</h3>

<p class="indent">Although she had got her arms round
him again, Mabel could not stop Dick&#39;s
voice. He had something to say and was
determined to say it; felt wound up to go.</p>

<p class="indent">"Breaking your heart!" he commented
contemptuously. "You have already broken
his; but you will have Percy to mend
yours."</p>

<p class="indent">"Percy! How dare you suggest such a
thing!"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her astonished; was startled
into absolute amazement at the indignation
in her voice as she broke away from him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dare! Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Percy!" She repeated the name scornfully.
"You know I hate, detest, despise,
loathe him."</p>

<p class="indent">Her face was so very expressive just then
that there could be no doubt she was saying
what she meant. Dick was quick to realize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
that. Was so astonished at the turn matters
had taken that he could only ejaculate:</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh!"</p>

<p class="indent">A small word, but all he felt capable of
shaping just then; was his way of expressing
the unutterable mystification and astonishment
which had gripped hold of him.</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>know</i> it, Dick!" Boot on floor:
tattoo resumed. "Don&#39;t stand there with
that idiotic vacant look on your face, as if
you were surprised to hear it."</p>

<p class="indent">Surprised! It was a feeble description;
idiotic was distinctly better. He stood as
one paralysed, listening whilst she excitedly
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have told you so dozens, hundreds,
thousands, millions of times!"</p>

<p class="indent">Trust a woman if she picks up figures to
shed them with a lavish hand! The blank
look on Dick&#39;s face intensified. He shook his
head in utter hopelessness; the mystery was
too much for him. He was dealing with a
woman, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, he was only an
average specimen of a man after all!</p>

<p class="indent">"Do I sleep?" He found voice at last;
quoted: "Do I dream? Or are visions
about?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I felt mad when I got the letter to say you
insisted on the Chantrelles coming here for
Christmas. But I didn&#39;t like to disappoint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
you, Dick, the moment of your home-coming,
too."</p>

<p class="indent">"I insisted?" He was all eagerness as he
blurted out the question. "Who says I
insisted?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Amy in her letter said so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"The awful liar!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nice way to talk of a lady!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lady be&mdash;I mean she&#39;s not a lady if she
set down such a thing in black and white. She
so badgered me on the boat with hints for an
invitation, that at last, in sheer desperation,
I did ask them to come."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you did! And I wish they
were a hundred thousand miles away!"</p>

<p class="indent">The blank look of astonishment crept on to
his face again as he stuttered:</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;wish&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes, yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;m&mdash;&mdash;Do&mdash;you&mdash;mean&mdash;to&mdash;tell&mdash;me
that you weren&#39;t glad to see them?
When during the whole of the first dinner you
did nothing but simper and make eyes and
laugh with Percy, till the veriest fool in
Christendom could have seen you were head
over ears in love with him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I hate him! I hate him! I Hate
Him!"</p>

<p class="indent">His sister&#39;s vehemence partly cleared the
clouds away. Acted as a douche on his bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
temper, as a tonic to his good one; coolly he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear girl, take my advice; you&#39;d
better send for the quack! Your mind&#39;s
unhinged; that&#39;s what&#39;s the matter with you.
You&#39;re fairly going dotty! If you hate him,
what the dev&mdash;deuce did you want to pretend
to make love to him for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I d&mdash;did it"&mdash;she was sobbing in her
handkerchief now; all the stiffening gone
from her back&mdash;"to annoy P&mdash;Prince
Ch&mdash;Ch&mdash;Charlie."</p>

<p class="indent">What there was left of the look of astonishment
quite left his face. The scales fell; his
eyes were fully opened. Thrusting his hands
into his pockets he said vigorously, characteristically:</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;I&#39;m&mdash;damned!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then hope sprang into his eyes; filled his
bosom. There was a tangle somewhere, but
he was getting his fingers on the ends: he
needed to unravel it. Walking over to, he sat
beside his sister, who was sobbing on the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">"Just hold up the water supply, old girl."
He spoke with all a brother&#39;s brutality.
"Turn off the tap, and talk coherently, if it
isn&#39;t too great a tax. I&#39;ve only got a man&#39;s
brain, so you might make an effort and leave
off conundruming. The way you women
twist up things&mdash;well, there! You seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
take a positive delight in making troubles for
yourselves and everybody else; put up
obstacles and cry because you can&#39;t get over
them. Why did you want to annoy Masters?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He insul&mdash;sul&mdash;sul&mdash;ted me so."</p>

<p class="indent">Once more a look of amazement crept on
Dick&#39;s face as he repeated:</p>

<p class="indent">"He&mdash;insulted&mdash;you&mdash;so?"</p>

<p class="indent">The idea of Prince Charlie&#39;s insulting a
woman was&mdash;well, he almost laughed as he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"For many weeks past he had not seen
you; for many weeks past I have been his
close companion. During all that time he has
spoken of you to me as if you were a goddess,
instead of being a little devil with a temper
vile enough to provoke a saint. He insult
you!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then he did laugh&mdash;heartily. Began to
see that there was a path out of the difficulty&mdash;it
only needed finding. Let him find it&mdash;that
was all!</p>

<p class="indent">"He c&mdash;c&mdash;could not have thought m&mdash;m&mdash;much
of me, or he would not have
f&mdash;f&mdash;flirted with every girl on board."</p>

<p class="indent">"Flirted! Prince Ch&mdash;&mdash;" His laugh
broke out again; into a roar this time. "Why,
he was the most taciturn beggar on the boat,
to everyone but me! Flirt! That&#39;s good.
Beyond a &#39;Good morning,&#39; I never heard him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
address a woman. If one at table asked him
for the water-bottle, he acted as if she had
done him a deadly wrong in speaking to him!
He was not even on pass-the-salt-and-pepper
terms with a lady on board. Flirt! This is
really too rich!"</p>

<p class="indent">The laughter rang out again. His anger
was all gone; his face was all sunshine.
There was a comedy side to the affair, after
all! That was the side of things Dick was
sure to reach sooner or later; his nature
tended that way. It served to detect the
merest trace of humour in things.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">A misgiving was seizing her. She was
putting two and two together and making a
decidedly unpleasant four of it; said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t it true that he made violent love to
Amy directly she came on board?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To Amy! To Amy! If there was one
woman he avoided&mdash;positively avoided&mdash;more
than another, it was Amy. He seemed
to take a dislike to her directly she was
introduced; and in justice to her, I am bound
to say that she reciprocated. From her point
of view, I suppose that was showing proper
feeling. She was for ever trying to poison
my mind against him. But I knew him, and
I knew her. She preached to the winds!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick had to pause. Having got hold of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
the offending root, his indignation was rising,
getting the better of him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Make love to her!" he repeated. "Good
Heavens! Beyond &#39;Good morning&#39; and
&#39;Good night&#39; I don&#39;t suppose he spoke a
hundred words to her on the whole voyage
home."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have been made a fool&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather an easy task, I should imagine,"
interjected Dick, with truly brotherly contempt.
"But who is responsible for the job?
Whoever it was, couldn&#39;t have been killed
with the hard work!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait."</p>

<p class="indent">She ran out of the room to her bedroom.
Quickly opening a drawer, made a moment&#39;s
search therein. Then returned with a letter
in her hand&mdash;triumphant.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is not altogether correct form for a
woman to show a man another woman&#39;s
letter, but read that."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick sat down at the table and she smoothed
the document out before him with a degree of
gusto. It was her warrant of justification;
the only title-deed she possessed to the behaviour
of which she had been guilty.</p>

<p class="indent">He read it. His face became worth watching
as he did so. Amusement, loathing,
astonishment, all held sway on it at odd times.
Despite his disgust though, there was big hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
in the sediment. As he concluded he whistled
his favourite "Rule Britannia."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">She had been eagerly watching him. Read
the answer in his face, but woman-like asked
what she already knew:</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t it true?"</p>

<p class="indent">"True!" He tossed the letter back to
her as he answered. "From beginning to
end it is a tissue of deliberate lies."</p>

<p class="indent">She heard rapturously. The moral worth
of her friend Amy and the ultimate destination
of Amy&#39;s soul, were matters for future
commiseration. They sank into insignificance
before the resuscitation of her faith in Masters.
That mighty edifice had been obscured by
clouds; the clouds were clearing and the
proud summit was peeping through.</p>

<p class="indent">So glad was she, that she positively revelled
in the admission of her own gullibility; said
joyously:</p>

<p class="indent">"Lies! And I believed them!"</p>

<p class="indent">"That doesn&#39;t astonish me! I used to
think you were a sensible girl, but now&mdash;well,
there! But there&#39;s more than mere lies in
that letter."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You can&#39;t see it? And you think yourself
cute! Can&#39;t you read between the lines?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
"I told Amy of Prince Charlie&#39;s love for
you; that started the ball. What does she
set herself to do? Poison your mind against
him. Why? Note the lie about Percy&#39;s
turning white when&mdash;&mdash;Good Lord, you can
see through it now, can&#39;t you? You don&#39;t
want spectacles for that? Your own common
sense will tell you&mdash;though you certainly don&#39;t
seem to have a large supply on hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;she wanted me&mdash;wanted her brother
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s it! You&#39;ve got the hammer on
the nail head at last! That accounts for her
questioning me as to how you were left under
the will; whether the money was settled on
you or not."</p>

<p class="indent">"What a perfect pair of beasts!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear, hear!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And you invited them here! How could
you? They are not fit people to have in the
house!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I like that! Upon my word! See how
gone you were on Percy at din&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! If you ever dare to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I must see about packing up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Packing up! Don&#39;t let me think you
quite a complete idiot, Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The train goes at three-thir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick!" She stamped her foot in anger.
"Why do you want to make it worse for me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
than it need be by your stupidity. You
perfect horror, you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Stupidity runs in the family, I suppose.
You have been mighty wise, haven&#39;t you?
Um&mdash;you don&#39;t want me to go, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And leave me in this hopeless muddle
alone? It wouldn&#39;t be commonly human&mdash;to
say nothing of brotherly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well." He affected a resigned air to
hide his smiles. "I suppose I&#39;ll have to stop
if you put it like that. I&#39;ll just walk up to
Prince Charlie&#39;s place and tell him I shan&#39;t be
able to go up with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"To&mdash;go&mdash;up&mdash;with&mdash;him?"</p>

<p class="indent">Dismay caused her to voice the question in
instalments. Dick stooped, pretended to tie
up his shoe-lace, some act was necessary to
hide from her the amused look in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I&#39;d like to say good-bye to the dear
old chap. He&#39;ll probably go abroad and stop
there. Maybe I shall never see him again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Abroad! Never&mdash;see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Then she stopped dead in the middle of
what she was saying; stood as one dumbfounded.
Dick&#39;s eyes in his averted head
were twinkling and his mouth twitching. She
certainly had some ground for the opinion she
expressed of him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a brute of a brother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>A TANGLED TRINITY</h3>

<p class="indent">An observer might have imagined Dick
possessed of a just grievance against his
tailor; it took him such a while to get into
his coat. He was doing so to the accompaniment
of "Rule, Britannia," pursed-up lips
fashioning it. The difficulty with his coat
was one of his own creation; he was thoroughly
enjoying the situation and prolonging
it as long as possible. The whistling served
as a sort of slow music to his little drama.</p>

<p class="indent">There was not even a whisper of Masters&#39;
leaving England. Indeed, it was pretty
certain that had he been going abroad, Dick
would have been on hand as his travelling
companion. He was, as he termed it, rubbing
it in. Brothers are awful brutes at
times.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Dear Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">She had come to him affectionately; had
put her arms round his neck.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
"Hold on there! Don&#39;t go slobbering on
my front again; it is all limp and wet now.
I don&#39;t want to get inflammation of the lungs
through wearing a damp shirt! You are too
liberal with your grief, Sis; keep some of it
for your handkerchief."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not crying. Dick&mdash;Dick&mdash;dear, dear
old Dick." She was whispering in his ear in
an artful way that she had never known
him able to resist. "You know you would
not like to make me miserable&mdash;your own
loving sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He was grinning from ear to ear. The
humour of the situation appealed to him as
he interrupted:</p>

<p class="indent">"None of your blarney; none of your soft
sawder! What&#39;s the meaning of this sudden
overflowing, spring-up-in-a-moment affection?
I was an idiot, fool, stupid, a few minutes
ago."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear Dick!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, that&#39;s all very well. But what is it?
This sudden discovery of my value means you
want something."</p>

<p class="indent">She put her mouth close to his ear and
whispered again. A very low whisper; he
only just caught it:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t let him go, Dick."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let who go?"</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that to be an evasion; that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
was wilfully misunderstanding her. Just
shook him and whispered earnestly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Please!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was magnanimous; he could afford
to be. His deep-laid scheme had proved
successful.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ll see what I can do. But what
are you going to do about the Chantrelles?"</p>

<p class="indent">A change came over her face; every scrap
of softness seemed to fade out of it. In a
voice full of determination she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"The Chantrelles will leave here before the
day is over!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rule, Britannia" once more thrilled the
air as the whistler caught his sister in his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a brick, old girl." He kissed her.
"Things will pan out all right after all. Now,
shall I stay and bear a hand, or would you
rather handle the precious couple all by
yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a steely glitter in her eye&mdash;it
boded ill for the absent ones&mdash;as she answered
vindictively:</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I can manage alone!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you can, old girl!... Do you
know," he added with mock severity, "when
you look a little demon like that, I don&#39;t
somehow fancy trusting my friend into your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
keeping. One good turn&mdash;&mdash;; you know the
rest. I believe I should be carrying that out
by preventing his marrying you."</p>

<p class="indent">"He hasn&#39;t asked me yet!"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke saucily with sparkling eyes; yet
with a rosy blush on her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s true; perhaps he won&#39;t! There&#39;s
hope for the poor beggar after all! He came
all the way from the Mediterranean framing
words how he should ask you to marry him,
and he had a narrow escape on the dinner
party night. Perhaps you killed him then
by your nice behaviour; killed any desire he
might have had to marry you." Then he
added maliciously: "Let&#39;s hope so, for his
sake."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! You are a perfect horror!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It was &#39;Dear Dick&#39; a minute ago! But
there&mdash;you&#39;re as uncertain as the weather."</p>

<p class="indent">The shot went home; told in the flushed,
shamefaced look; Dick inquired:</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you going to say to the Chantrelles?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That is my business. They will travel
up by the afternoon train. Your business is
to go to Prince Charlie, and see that he comes
here to-night to dinner."</p>

<p class="indent">He sobered down in a moment at that;
answered seriously:</p>

<p class="indent">"No, old girl, that is out of the question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
Nothing I could say would induce
him to that. He simply hates the Chantrelles."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have told you&mdash;they won&#39;t be here."</p>

<p class="indent">"Even the knowledge of their absence
wouldn&#39;t make him come to your house, after
the way in which you behaved to him last
time."</p>

<p class="indent">"All the same," she said defiantly, "a
place shall be set for him at table."</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here, old girl, I&#39;m willing to help
you, but don&#39;t make a pocket idiot of yourself.
I tell you nothing I could say would induce
him to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you can get him to go for a walk, I
suppose, can&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know we always go for a walk late
every afternoon&mdash;weather permitting or
otherwise."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well; this afternoon walk eastwards.
You know the seat at the end of the
Parade?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean, that one by the wall, which
Gracie calls Our Seat?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Make your way there; walk to
that, sit down and wait&mdash;till I come."</p>

<p class="indent">It dawned on him then: her intent.
Admiration of her diplomacy found vent in
the strains of "Rule, Britannia."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t say anything, Dick. Promise me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
that. Not a word to Prince Charlie about&mdash;about&mdash;anything."</p>

<p class="indent">"But when you turn up at the seat, what
am I to do? I suppose it will be a case of
two&#39;s company, three&#39;s none?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you can go and pick shells and seaweed
on the beach!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What! In the dark? Is thy brother a dog
that he should do these things? I&#39;ll find my
way back by myself. You think he&#39;ll see
you home?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You can rely on it he will."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Seton-Carr had confidence in herself.
Perhaps it was as well; few things are won
without that.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right. We shall be there about five
o&#39;clock."</p>

<p class="indent">"So shall I."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right.... There are the Chantrelles
coming up the road; I&#39;ll clear out the back
way. If they are going, I&#39;d rather be spared
saying farewells. I might introduce some
choice expressions of my opinion of them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Leave that to me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mabel spoke with bitter sweetness. One
glance at her face convinced Dick that he
could do so with safety.</p>

<p class="indent">"Right!"</p>

<p class="indent">He disappeared through the back as the
Chantrelles entered by the front door. Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
Seton-Carr was waiting for them. She smiled
pleasantly, iced pleasantry, and invited them
into the drawing-room. Seated, she faced
them. There, wasted no time in preliminaries;
struck out:</p>

<p class="indent">"There is something I want to clear up,
Mr. Chantrelle."</p>

<p class="indent">She fixed that gentleman with her eyes.
On her face was a pleasant smile; it never
faded once during the interview.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About Mr. Masters," she continued.
"There has been something unpleasant&mdash;so
far as he is concerned&mdash;said of the voyage
home you all made from the Mediterranean.
Did you ever see him attempt to make love
to your sister?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Great Scott! No. He seemed to like her
about as little as Amy liked him."</p>

<p class="indent">From the corner of her eye, Mrs. Seton-Carr
could see that her dear friend Amy had grown
very white&mdash;Amy had a quicker brain than
had her brother&mdash;but she never lost her hold
on Percy&#39;s face; went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"Did he bear the reputation of a lady-killer?
Of making love to every woman on
board?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Mrs. Carr!" Percy laughed
heartily as he replied, "I never saw him talk
to a woman! He had the reputation on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
board of being a woman-hater. He was a
perfect bear!"</p>

<p class="indent">Amy glanced at her brother reproachfully,
meaningly&mdash;too late. Besides, he was looking
at his hostess and not at her; her telegraphic
communication was without effect. It was a
pity, a thousand pities, from Amy&#39;s point of
view. She had to sit quiet and listen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks so much," Mrs. Seton-Carr was
saying sweetly. "You see, I was told all that,
and it was not a pleasant thing to be told.
You must understand that I am engaged to
be married to Mr. Masters shortly&mdash;but I
think you knew that?"</p>

<p class="indent">Percy&#39;s face fell; all the merriment dropped
out of it. A moment&#39;s silence ensued; not
what could fairly be labelled a dull moment.
Then Percy broke it; said slowly:</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I had not the slightest idea of such
a thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that possible? Surely your sister told
you! She says in this letter that when you
heard of my forthcoming marriage to Mr.
Masters you grew white. Although why,"
she laughed, "you should grow white, I
cannot conceive. Our pleasant intercourse
has always been quite platonic, hasn&#39;t it?
That was its charm; one has so few friends.
You know that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;yes. Now I know it."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
"I am sorry to say it, Mr. Chantrelle, to
you; you always have behaved as a gentleman
to me; but this letter," she held it out to him,
"written by your sister whilst on the boat, is
a tissue of lies from beginning to end. The
work of a woman absolutely unfitted&mdash;in my
opinion&mdash;for decent society!"</p>

<p class="indent">Brother and sister were on their feet in a
moment. The atmosphere seemed red-hot
to them. They had had unpleasant moments
in their somewhat adventurous career, but
this was the worst. Their hostess&#39;s words
were as the lashes of a whip.</p>

<p class="indent">Chantrelle muttered something about
breaking the laws of hospitality; a weak
effort to stand up for his sister. It failed
half-way. Then he abandoned her to her
fate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take me away, Percy," his sister gasped.
"I will not stay to be further insulted."</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Chantrelle has forestalled me." Mrs.
Seton-Carr still spoke quietly, still retained
her seat. "That is precisely what I was
about to ask you to do, Mr. Chantrelle. One
can lock up from a thief, but a liar&mdash;a
deliberate, scheming, unscrupulous liar&mdash;there
is no guarding against. Your sister, by her
trickery, came near separating me from the
man who loves me, the man I love. I should
not forgive it in fifty lifetimes."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
Miss Chantrelle made an effort to speak.
Her lips moved, but for once in her life she
was unable to fashion words. She was a
woman who trusted to a well-oiled tongue
for squeezing out of the tightest places. It
failed her now; the effort ended in a gasp.</p>

<p class="indent">"Go and pack your things, Amy."</p>

<p class="indent">Her brother spoke sternly. The white-faced
woman almost staggered out of the
room without a word. She was terribly
upset; none of us like to be found out in our
little lapses.</p>

<p class="indent">"Read the letter, Mr. Chantrelle; I request
you to. It will convince you that I am not
more than necessarily bitter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no need. Your word is sufficient."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chantrelle bowed; had changed his
tactics and was making the best of his position.
His sister had led him into this; he would
stand by her up to a point, but at the same
time he would do what he could to save his
own skin. There was no sense in needless
sacrifice.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know you well enough, know you could
only behave as you are doing with good
reason," he continued. "I am heartily sorry.
Amy is my sister; I am bound to remember
that whatever she has done." He held out his
hand. "Good-bye. I can only ask you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
acquit me personally of any&mdash;but there;
explanations are perhaps better left alone.
Good-bye&mdash;it will be well for us not to meet
again."</p>

<p class="indent">A note of feeling vibrated in his voice. A
mere listener to the actual words would have
detected no false ring in them. Would,
perhaps, have admired him for the staunchness
he exhibited towards his misguided
sister.</p>

<p class="indent">But his hostess stood face to face with him,
and she saw that in his eye&mdash;lack of sincerity&mdash;which
discounted the ingenuousness of his
speech. Still Mrs. Seton-Carr agreed with
it&mdash;in substance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye. Yes, it is certainly better
so.... My maid shall go across to the
station for a porter and truck. They will be
here by the time you have packed."</p>

<p class="indent">They were. The Chantrelles left. Journeyed
to London by the train Dick had
mentioned; the most crestfallen couple
travelling in it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the last of them.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>OUR SEAT</h3>

<p class="indent">The Chantrelles gone, with the whistle
of their departing train shrilling in her
ears, Mabel sighed contentedly, gathered
all there was of her together and spent a full
two minutes in inspecting its reflection in
the mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the closing of the door on
them as they left had been sweet music in
her ears. The warning shriek of the engine
as it started out of the station, drawing them
every moment further and further away from
her, was sweeter still.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she entered into consultation with
her cook; set about ordering the most
appetising little dinner she could devise.
There was entailed an expenditure of anxious
thought; the function was an important one.
Mrs. Seton-Carr was not a woman to despise
details of that kind.</p>

<p class="indent">She had laughed once at a cynic&#39;s belief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
that, if you cannot make sure of retaining
a man&#39;s love, you can, by securing the services
of a good cook, make sure of his respect.
Despite her laughter she was not without
faith in the proverb that the road to a man&#39;s
heart lies through his stomach.</p>

<p class="indent">The last time Prince Charlie had dined at
Ivy Cottage he had not enjoyed himself;
she remembered why with a little flush of
shame. There was determination that he
should do so this time. And she rather
thought she would enjoy herself too; anyway,
it would not be her fault if they failed
to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">The shades of evening began their descent
soon after half-past four o&#39;clock. It was
not too dark then for her to see her brother
and Prince Charlie go by on the Parade&mdash;eastwards.
The author&#39;s broad, square
shoulders were unmistakable. She herself
was hidden by the bedroom curtain she was
behind.</p>

<p class="indent">They had gone in the direction of the
seat. A smile found place on her face; so
far all was well. Then she tried on two or
three hats. Was anxious to look her best;
she knew that she could talk so much better
when sure of her appearance. Sadness tinged
her reflection; the beauty of her millinery
would be wasted in the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
Then, with a sigh&mdash;she was a woman, with
all a woman&#39;s belief in millinery&#39;s power&mdash;she
hoped that not much talking would be
needed. Silence and a good profile were
more reliable. She looked at the clock: the
minutes dragged slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">At a quarter to five she left the cottage.
Before the hour reached the end of the Parade.
An east wind was blowing. As she neared
the seat the odour of cigars came to her, borne
on the wind from which the smokers were
sheltered. Then she advanced.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo, Sis!"</p>

<p class="indent">Dick started to his feet as if she were an
apparition, spoke in an exaggerated tone of
surprise; continuing:</p>

<p class="indent">"Who on earth would have thought of
seeing you here?"</p>

<p class="indent">She could have soundly boxed his ears for
him&mdash;well-meaning Dick&mdash;for so overdoing it.
He could not have exhibited more surprise
had he thought her dropped from the clouds.
Brothers really are terribly trying at times.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps it was as well for him that he
slowly moved away. Apparently he evinced
a judicious, if sudden, interest in moonlight
conchology. Anyway, he devoted his attention
to some of the common objects of the
sea-shore.</p>

<p class="indent">That Dick did move off was the essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
point. She saw, with relief, that he had sense
enough for that. The sound of the whistling
of "Rule Britannia" gradually died away in
the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters had risen to his feet the moment
his eyes fell on her. Stood there doubtful
what he should do. She did not leave him in
doubt long; advanced towards him, and
stretching out her hand, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Prince Charlie, I am&mdash;oh, I am so sorry!
Please forgive me!"</p>

<p class="indent">It was a lame speech. She was surprised
at, ashamed of, herself. She had rehearsed
what she had intended saying all the afternoon.
Now it came to the point she could
not remember a word.</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever she might think of her own words
they were an immense surprise to Masters.
He took her extended hand, common courtesy
compelled him to that, and said gently:</p>

<p class="indent">"Forgive? You are surely&mdash;oh, I have
nothing to forgive!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You have!"</p>

<p class="indent">She insisted with a charming insistence.
Somehow her eyes got to need mopping with
her handkerchief&mdash;a lace handkerchief with a
singularly pretty border, by the way.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have b-behaved"&mdash;she mopped on&mdash;"like
a wicked wretch t-to you."</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, with a man of Masters&#39; temperament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
it was most effective; she was playing
an ideal game. Some men are used to tears;
come to look upon them as an unavoidable
factor in their dealings with women. The
author had not reached that stage: probably
never would.</p>

<p class="indent">A woman crying, or in distress, never failed
to appeal to him. Perhaps Mrs. Seton-Carr
knew that. Women are very subtle; their
intuition is no mythical possession. Any way,
she played that handkerchief of hers for all it
was worth.</p>

<p class="indent">Masters still stood hesitating; was genuinely
anxious and full of wonder: what he
ought to do. Thoughts of eau de Cologne
occurred to him. He knew women found
relief in that kind of thing; but he bent over
her and said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg you&mdash;oh, I beg, earnestly, you will
not distress yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">He really meant it; her distress distressed
him. The more she saw that the more tears
she shed. Artful little crocodile!</p>

<p class="indent">"You w-won&#39;t f-f-forgive me!"</p>

<p class="indent">She knew all the time that he would.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray, Mrs.&mdash;you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have nothing to
forgive. But if you think I have, I forgive
you freely, fully."</p>

<p class="indent">The road was getting smooth, she thought,
but it was not safe to drop the handkerchief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
yet; plainly that was a strong
weapon.</p>

<p class="indent">"You m-m-must think me such an awful
b-b-brute!"</p>

<p class="indent">Wretched little prevaricator! She knew
quite well that he thought nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p class="indent">"Believe me, I can never think of you in
any way but the kindliest."</p>

<p class="indent">True; every word of it. His heart was
like a photographic plate, capable only of
bearing one clear picture.</p>

<p class="indent">"I d-daresay you wish me dead, or at the
bottom of the s-sea&mdash;and I d-deserve it."</p>

<p class="indent">Really she did. It was most unfair&mdash;this
present performance of hers. It distressed
him beyond measure; he said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish you nothing but the greatest
happiness it is possible for you to enjoy;
wish it from my heart."</p>

<p class="indent">"And I&mdash;I&mdash;have behaved so&mdash;s-s-so ungratefully
to you."</p>

<p class="indent">She uttered truth; perhaps for a change.
But he denied what she said; answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at all! You behaved rightly; as
your heart dictated."</p>

<p class="indent">She had to flare up at that; could not
help it. As a matter of fact all her actions
had been in direct opposition to her heart&#39;s
promptings.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
"I did nothing of the sort! My behaviour
was quite wrong!"</p>

<p class="indent">The handkerchief shifted a little to enable
her to look up at him out of the corner of her
eye, as she continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Just the reverse of the way my h-h-heart
dictated."</p>

<p class="indent">His own heart beat a little quicker at that,
in expectation, as he asked eagerly:</p>

<p class="indent">"When was that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At that wr-r-retched dinner."</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down; somehow they both sat&mdash;apparently
it was a simultaneous act. He
was, however, to windward of her; she
engineered that. The faint perfume of the
hair of her bent head came to him. It has
been already mentioned that Mrs. Seton-Carr
devoted attention to details. No wonder the
elder Weller warned his son against widows!</p>

<p class="indent">"You have said either not enough or too
much." He spoke hoarsely, in tense tones.
"Tell me&mdash;more."</p>

<p class="indent">"You want to make it h-h-hard for me;
to humble me m-m-more."</p>

<p class="indent">She sobbed out the words, the while her
disengaged hand, curiously, fell on his. Naturally,
his hand closed on hers, and&mdash;quite
easily&mdash;he frustrated her efforts to take it
away. He moved closer to her.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned the back of her head to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
Was not unaware of the fact that her hair
grew very prettily there; fell in soft little
golden curls at the nape of her neck. Of
course the movement was quite an unconscious
one! Perhaps, too, it was pure accident
that the moon just then had popped
from behind a cloud, so lighting up things;
she went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"I t-think you are very h-hard to me."</p>

<p class="indent">He moved closer still; every fibre in his
being thrilled by contact with the woman he
loved. Had he bent down, his lips would
have touched her head. The blood was
racing through his veins as he wondered&mdash;should
he dare? Then he thought of the
dinner party&mdash;remembered Chantrelle. The
thought acted as the descent of iced water
might have done: she was another man&#39;s
property! He took his hand away.</p>

<p class="indent">That alarmed her&mdash;dreadfully! She had
thought all was going along so nicely; was
actually getting ready for the union of lips;
the final drying of her eyes. What could
possibly have frozen him up like that?</p>

<p class="indent">"I am sorry," he said, "you should think
unpleasant things of me. But is there
need?"</p>

<p class="indent">The coldness of his tone struck a horrible
chill to her heart. But it was not a moment
for despair, rather for a marshalling of all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
forces. She redoubled her efforts; fell on
her knees by his side, and cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"You are cruel! I am kneeling to you,
asking you to forgive me, and you won&#39;t!
I knelt to you once before&mdash;here on this spot&mdash;and
you were cruel to me then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, yes!"</p>

<p class="indent">He interrupted her; the memory of his
brutality then&mdash;he called it so&mdash;returned to
him; his words came hurriedly:</p>

<p class="indent">"For that I need your forgiveness; I
ought to abjectly apologise. What I did,
said, then was wholly under a misapprehension&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She seized on that: it gave her a chance.
Moreover, it was now or never&mdash;so she thought.
Metaphorically she set her teeth and said&mdash;Now.
Actually she whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t it possible perhaps, that you may
be under a misapprehension now?"</p>

<p class="indent">She boldly raised her head and looked him
straight in the face as she spoke. Tears had
not in the least, strange to say, disfigured
hers; her grief had not been that kind! She
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t do as you did then; don&#39;t push me
away from you!"</p>

<p class="indent">That was a rubbing of it in with a vengeance.
Had the effect of making him speak
with a strange quiver in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
"Please&mdash;please get up! I don&#39;t like&mdash;I
can&#39;t bear&mdash;to see you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Her disobedience was of the studied kind.
She got so close to him that he felt the
warmth of her body, the up-creep of her
hands on his breast, the sweet warm breath
from her lips. So holding him&mdash;holding in
every sense of the word&mdash;she said with a
spice of defiance in her voice:</p>

<p class="indent">"I won&#39;t get up till you tell me you forgive
me everything!"</p>

<p class="indent">She had him at such a disadvantage!
It was really grossly unfair. The poor wretch
did not know whether he was on his head
or his heels. Then, almost before he knew
what he was doing, his arms were about her;
he could not help it. He gripped her to him
so closely that she could have cried out&mdash;but
it was too sweet a pain to ask relief from.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me." His voice was raucous in its
hoarseness. "You do not&mdash;do not belong
to Chantrelle?"</p>

<p class="indent">A laugh came to her lips. A tinge of
jealousy in the man she loves pleases a woman,
spices things as it were. Besides, looked at
from the right view-point, it is the subtlest of
flattery.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence her laughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS EVE</h3>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Seton Carr seemed in no hurry
to withdraw herself from the author&#39;s
tightly clasping arms. Seriously, it was
really very disgraceful behaviour of hers.
She excused herself with the knowledge that
there was no audience: save the moon and
the sea. After subsidence of her laugh she
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have said good-bye for ever to the
Chantrelles. They have left Ivy Cottage.
I shall never see them again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I loved him?" she interrupted gleefully.
"I didn&#39;t&mdash;I just hated him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yet you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pretended I did because I wanted to
annoy you! There! I wanted to annoy
you because&mdash;I.... Don&#39;t, Prince Charlie!
You&#39;re making me look so untidy.... Yes do&mdash;I
don&#39;t mind.... They&#39;ll think it was the
wind."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
Thoughts of other people and of dinner
came to them at last. But it was half-past
seven before they started to walk back home.
What they said during all the time they were
on the seat is a matter of concern to themselves
only.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides which, when people are in love,
their conversation is not remarkable for
originality and general interest. Even authors
get out of the stirrups&mdash;off their high
horse&mdash;and talk like other people.</p>

<p class="indent">She explained to him that she had loved
him from the first. He, wondering how he
could have been blind to the fact, hugged her
close again. Thereupon, she complained that
he hurt her, and then contradicted herself;
in fact behaved like a true woman.</p>

<p class="indent">She confessed why she had not told him
she was Mrs. Seton-Carr at first: because
she was a leader of London fashion, and she
knew he hated London Society and everything
connected therewith. The newspaper
people chronicled her movements and she
was much talked about; she had thought
he would not fail to recognize her name.</p>

<p class="indent">But she need not have feared; he would
not have done so. Fashionable Intelligence,
and all columns captioned in kindred
fashion, he never read. Had an idea of
his own that in the study of mankind his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
society papers were not very suitable textbooks.</p>

<p class="indent">It would naturally be supposed that seeing
how late it was they would have hurried
home. Not they! It was nearly eight
o&#39;clock when they reached Ivy Cottage.
Dick was waiting for them.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is a pretty idea, upon my soul!"
His greeting. "A nice way to treat your
brother! Dinner has been waiting hours!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind, Dick dear," replied his
sister, pecking at his lips as she removed the
pins from her hat. "It doesn&#39;t matter, it
really doesn&#39;t matter in the least."</p>

<p class="indent">"Doesn&#39;t it! It matters to me! Am
I supposed to be a fasting man, giving a seaside
exhibition of myself? There&#39;s been no
midday meal, because I had to bolt whilst
you were turning people out of the house
neck and crop. I did think I was going to
get some dinner! I don&#39;t even get an apology.
You&#39;re flouncing around grinning all
over your face as if you&#39;d picked up sixpence.
What have you been doing?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There&mdash;sit down&mdash;like a good boy. Here&#39;s
the soup coming. Now start and try to make
up for lost time."</p>

<p class="indent">She ran to her room and threw off her hat
and mantle. Laughed at her reflection in the
glass&mdash;a laugh inspired by sheer happiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
Then she crept softly into Gracie&#39;s room; the
child was not yet asleep, though sleepy.
Bending over the cot she kissed the little
rosy face, and Gracie&#39;s arms went up and
around the neck of her Dear Miss Mivvins.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Seton-Carr had not been away from
the dining room more than two minutes;
when she returned to take her place at table
mischievous Dick was ready waiting for her,
said:</p>

<p class="indent">"What I want to know is, what the deuce
you two have been sitting out on that blessed
seat all night for? Why couldn&#39;t you come
in like rational beings and sit in chairs and
talk?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never you mind, Dick; don&#39;t ask
questions. Have some more soup?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you can&#39;t stop my mouth with soup!
I have been kept without food for so long
that I&#39;m afraid to eat much! I expect it
was some of that tommy-rot Prince Charlie
was always flooding my ears with. About
your eyes and hair and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, Dick," interrupted Masters, "drop
that please. It is a forbidden subject."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it? I am not to talk about what
you said?" He turned to his sister and
continued: "What have you had to say then,
Sis? Been telling him how you begged and
prayed of me not to let him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
"Dick! If you don&#39;t be quiet, I&#39;ll never
forgive you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, look here." Dick assumed an
aggrieved tone. "Am I supposed not to talk
at all? Is this house run on the silent
system? I might just as well be having
dinner in a deaf and dumb asylum."</p>

<p class="indent">"Talk sensibly then," said his sister patronisingly,
"and we&#39;ll listen to you with pleasure."</p>

<p class="indent">"We! Oh, it&#39;s reached that stage, has
it: plural! &#39;M very well. Let&#39;s take up a
serious subject: horribly serious. Have you
lunatics decided when your two throbbing
hearts are going to be merged into one;
when you are to be married?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick! Don&#39;t you want&mdash;let me pass
you some more vegetables!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t stop his thirst for information,"
interposed Masters quietly. "He&#39;s got to
be best man, so he may as well know. It is
settled that we are to be married by special
licence on New Year&#39;s Day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Prince Charlie!" she cried. "I
never said&mdash;indeed I didn&#39;t&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, dear," he replied calmly. "I know
you did not. But you said that that
woman I made love to on the boat&mdash;what
was her name?&mdash;Amy&mdash;pass the sauce,
Dick&mdash;alleged that I said it rested with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
me, so far as the naming of the day was
concerned."</p>

<p class="indent">"How can you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"It occurred to me that that was a capital
idea. I am not one of those superior persons;
am never above taking a hint. I know I have
had&mdash;thanks to you&mdash;the most unhappy end
of a year. By way of compensation I am
going&mdash;thanks to you again&mdash;to have a most
happy beginning of one."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick viewed the consternation displayed
on his sister&#39;s face to the accompaniment of a
broad grin on his own, said:</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s right! Start quarrelling now,
even before you are tied up! Goodness
knows what it will be like after, when
you are sentenced to&mdash;I mean when you
are linked for life. Miserable wretches!
You have my sincerest sympathy; all my
pity."</p>

<p class="indent">"It takes two to make a quarrel."</p>

<p class="indent">Prince Charlie uttering the aphorism. Then
with a smile, holding out his hand to Mabel,
he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"You agree with me, don&#39;t you, darling?
Just by your action convince this beardless
youth that we are in accord about the first
of January&mdash;if we are to be married on that
day, put your hand in mine."</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated a moment, perhaps her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
brother&#39;s derisive laugh helped to her action:
she put it right there.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s one thing about this affair&mdash;having
long been an acute sufferer from my
headstrong sister&#39;s temper," said Dick, grinning
all over his face&mdash;"about which I am
distinctly displeased."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are going to make one of your terrible
jokes, Dick!" she said. "I can see it
in your face!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, let him run loose," interposed Masters.
"It&#39;s Christmas time, you know.
What&#39;s the joke? If it&#39;s going to give us
pain, out with it&mdash;as the boy said to the
dentist."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you labour over one of your usual
atrocious puns, Dick," warned his sister,
"I&#39;ll throw you down and pummel you black
and blue!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was merely going to observe," said her
brother, regardless of the threat, "that I was
glad that at length you had found your
master!"</p>

<p class="indent">He had to howl for mercy before she let
him go.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>THE CHRISTMAS BOX</h3>

<p class="indent">Gracie had to be reckoned with. Prince
Charlie was looked on as her exclusive
property. Considerable diplomacy and tact
would have to be brought to bear; that
exacting atom of humanity needed careful
handling.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Dick, with a thoughtfulness which
earned from his sister and prospective brother-in-law
grateful thanks, went out, late as it
was, and routed round the few shops of which
Wivernsea boasted. The shops were full
of people and empty of wares. By diligent
search he ran to earth in a grocer&#39;s shop a
box of crackers, packed by Tom Smith, as he
needed to find it packed: labelled Pantomime.
He thought that would answer the
purpose of conciliating his niece.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not disappointed. On the morrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
with a harlequin&#39;s cap and mask, a wand,
and conjured up recollections of last year&#39;s
pantomime all went well. Promise of a visit
that week to another pantomime completed
the matter. There was no breach.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie gave up all rights in Prince Charlie.
Indeed, viewed his changing into the character
of a new papa with curious equanimity.
Curious, that is to say, to any one ignorant
of her knowledge of the doings of fairies.
The literature upon which she fed was of
the divided syllable type. A story without
a fairy in it was beneath her contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was that on Christmas morning she
viewed the matter complacently. Having
disposed of Prince Charlie to her mother,
she gave him Miss Mivvins as a Christmas
box. Borrowed his fountain pen, and in a
large round hand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"<i>With best wishes for a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.</i>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Dancing up to, and putting this into Miss
Mivvins&#39; hand, she gracefully led that lady
to her former prince; was rejoiced when
she saw how glad he was to accept her
gift!</p>

<p class="indent">And the wish was realized too: their
Christmas was of the merriest. Gracie said
she had never spent so happy a one in all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
years of her life; was of opinion that the
harlequin had been at work with Uncle
Dick; he was so different from what he
used to be.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Dick was, and he knew it. Looked
back at his past with eyes full of horror,
at his prospective brother-in-law with love
in them, because he felt, knew, to whom his
reformation was due.</p>

<p class="indent">Gracie&#39;s other wish was granted: the new
year was a happy one. It commenced with
the actual transformation of Prince Charlie
into Gracie&#39;s new papa. The child said she
had never made a change which pleased her
so much.</p>

<p class="indent">As Gracie wisely observed, it was not now
a matter of occasional calls, he was always
there. So much better, wasn&#39;t it? She
really thought they had all been quite foolish
not to think of arranging it so before.</p>

<p class="indent">As to Uncle Dick&mdash;well, as Gracie said,
he was changed. And it was a permanent
change, too; he feared no relapse. Just
sometimes the memory of the old evil times
would return, and a suspicious moisture come
into his eyes. He could not help thinking of
what might have been, and what was.
Thanked God from his heart for his present
condition.</p>

<p class="indent">As to Miss Mivvins&mdash;well, of course she no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
longer exists. She merged into Mrs. Masters
on the first day of the new year.</p>

<p class="indent">Another change which had Gracie&#39;s full
approval.</p>

<p class="h2">THE END.</p>
